## Usage

In keeping with a 'pure' micro-services approach, this image runs a Matomo service only (in the form of FastCGI). Because of that it **must** be used with companion containers which provide a database for data storage and HTTP to FastCGI proxy/translation services for the user interface.

## Runtime

You can run the Matomo container and service like so:

```console
docker run -d --link some-mysql:db matomo
```

This assumes you've already launched a suitable MySQL or MariaDB database container.

You'll now need to use a suitable reverse proxy to access the user interface; which is available on TCP port 9000. Nginx provides the necessary functions for translation between HTTP and FastCGI.

## Matomo Installation

Once you're up and running, you'll arrive at the configuration wizard page. If you're using the compose file, at the `Database Setup` step, please enter the following:

-	Database Server: `db`
-	Login: `root`
-	Password: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
-	Database Name: piwik (or you can choose)

And leave the rest as default.

Then you can continue the installation with the super user.

## Docker-compose examples and log import instructions

A minimal set-up using docker-compose is available in the [.examples folder](https://github.com/matomo-org/docker/tree/master/.examples).

If you want to use the import logs script, you can then run the following container as needed, in order to execute the python import logs script:

```console
docker run --rm --volumes-from="matomo_app_1" --link matomo_app_1 python:2-alpine python /var/www/html/misc/log-analytics/import_logs.py --url=http://ip.of.your.piwik --login=yourlogin --password=yourpassword --idsite=1 --recorders=4 /var/www/html/logs/access.log
```

# Image Variants

The `matomo` images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific use case.

## `matomo:<version>`

This is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both as a throw away container (mount your source code and start the container to start your app), as well as the base to build other images off of.

## `matomo:<version>-alpine`

This image is based on the popular [Alpine Linux project](http://alpinelinux.org), available in [the `alpine` official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine). Alpine Linux is much smaller than most distribution base images (~5MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images in general.

This variant is highly recommended when final image size being as small as possible is desired. The main caveat to note is that it does use [musl libc](http://www.musl-libc.org) instead of [glibc and friends](http://www.etalabs.net/compare_libcs.html), so certain software might run into issues depending on the depth of their libc requirements. However, most software doesn't have an issue with this, so this variant is usually a very safe choice. See [this Hacker News comment thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10782897) for more discussion of the issues that might arise and some pro/con comparisons of using Alpine-based images.

To minimize image size, it's uncommon for additional related tools (such as `git` or `bash`) to be included in Alpine-based images. Using this image as a base, add the things you need in your own Dockerfile (see the [`alpine` image description](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) for examples of how to install packages if you are unfamiliar).
