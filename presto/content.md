# Presto Docker Image

## About the Container

This Docker image is designed to provide the following

-	An out-of-the-box single node cluster with the JMX, memory, TPC-DS, and TPC-H catalogs
-	An image that can be deployed as a full cluster by mounting in configuration
-	An image to be used as the basis for the Kubernetes Presto operator

## Quickstart

### Run the Presto server

You can launch a single node Presto cluster for testing purposes. The Presto node will function both as a coordinator and a worker. To launch it, execute the following:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 --name presto prestosql/presto
```

Wait for the following message log line:

	INFO    main    io.prestosql.server.PrestoServer    ======== SERVER STARTED ========

The Presto server is now running on `localhost:8080` (the default port).

### Run the Presto CLI

Run the [Presto CLI](https://prestosql.io/docs/current/installation/cli.html), which connects to `localhost:8080` by default:

```bash
docker exec -it presto presto
```

You can pass additional arguments to the Presto CLI:

```bash
docker exec -it presto presto --catalog tpch --schema sf1
```

## Configuration

Configuration is expected to be mounted to either to `/etc/presto` or `/usr/lib/presto/etc` (the latter takes precedence). If neither of these exists then the default single node configuration will be used.

### Specific Config Options

#### `node.id`

The container supplied `run-presto` command will set the config property `node.id` to the hostname of the container if it is not specified in the `node.properties` file. This allows for `node.properties` to be a static file across all worker nodes if desired. Additionally this has the added benefit of `node.id` being consistent, predictable, and stable through restarts.

#### `node.data-dir`

The default configuration uses `/data/presto` as the default for `node.data-dir`. Thus if using the default configuration and a mounted volume is desired for the data directory it should be mounted to `/data/presto`.
