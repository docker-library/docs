# What is R?

R is a system for statistical computation and graphics. It consists of a
language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger, access to
certain system functions, and the ability to run programs stored in script
files.

The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for
developing statistical software and data analysis. Polls and surveys of data
miners are showing R's popularity has increased substantially in recent
years.

R is an implementation of the S programming language combined with lexical
scoping semantics inspired by Scheme. S was created by John Chambers while at
Bell Labs. R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University
of Auckland, New Zealand, and is currently developed by the R Development
Core Team, of which Chambers is a member. R is named partly after the first
names of the first two R authors and partly as a play on the name of S.

R is a GNU project. The source code for the R software environment is written
primarily in C, Fortran, and R. R is freely available under the GNU General
Public License, and pre-compiled binary versions are provided for various
operating systems. R uses a command line interface; however, several
graphical user interfaces are available for use with R.

# How to use this image

## Interactive R ##

Launch R directly for interactive work:

    docker run -ti --rm r-base

## Batch mode ##

Link the working directory to run R batch commands. We recommend specifying a
non-root user when linking a volume to the container to avoid permission
changes, as illustrated here:

    docker run -ti --rm -v "$PWD":/home/docker -w /home/docker -u docker r-base R CMD check .

Alternatively, just run a bash session on the container first.  This allows a
user to run batch commands and also edit and run scripts:

    docker run -ti --rm r-base /usr/bin/bash
    vim.tiny myscript.R

Write the script in the container, exit `vim` and run `Rscript`

    Rscript myscript.R

## Dockerfiles ##

Use `r-base` as a base for your own Dockerfiles. For instance, something along
the lines of the following will compile and run your project:

    FROM r-base:latest
    COPY . /usr/local/src/myscripts
    WORKDIR /usr/local/src/myscripts
    CMD ["Rscript", "myscript.R"]

Build your image with the command:

    docker build -t myscript /path/to/Dockerfile

Running this container with no command will execute the script. Alternatively, a
user could run this container in interactive or batch mode as described above,
instead of linking volumes.

[rocker-org](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/wiki) project wiki.
