# What is Node.js?

Node.js is a software platform for scalable server-side and networking
applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript and can be run
within the Node.js runtime on Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux without changes.

Node.js applications are designed to maximize throughput and efficiency, using
non-blocking I/O and asynchronous events. Node.js applications run
single-threaded, although Node.js uses multiple threads for file and network
events. Node.js is commonly used for real-time applications due to its
asynchronous nature.

Node.js internally uses the Google V8 JavaScript engine to execute code; a large
percentage of the basic modules are written in JavaScript. Node.js contains a
built-in, asynchronous I/O library for file, socket, and HTTP communication. The
HTTP and socket support allows Node.js to act as a web server without additional
software such as Apache.

# How to use this image

## Create a `Dockerfile` in your Node.js app project

    FROM node:0.10-onbuild
    # replace this with your application's default port
    EXPOSE 8888

You can then build and run the Docker image:

    docker build -t my-nodejs-app .
    docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-nodejs-app

### Notes

The image assumes that your application has a file named
[`package.json`](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/json.html) listing its dependencies
and defining its [start
script](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/misc/npm-scripts.html#default-values).

## Run a single Node.js script

For many simple, single file projects, you may find it inconvenient to write a
complete `Dockerfile`. In such cases, you can run a Node.js script by using the
Node.js Docker image directly:

    docker run -it --rm --name my-running-script -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp node:0.10 node your-daemon-or-script.js
