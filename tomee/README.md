# What is TomEE?

[Apache TomEE](http://tomee.apache.org/), pronounced "Tommy", is an all-Apache Java EE Web Profile certified stack where Apache Tomcat is top dog. Apache TomEE is assembled from a vanilla Apache Tomcat zip file. We start with Apache Tomcat, add our jars and zip up the rest. The result is Tomcat with added EE features - TomEE.

![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker-library/docs/4a10a52c08621b68c1b1b53b561f819d9e78c2e0/tomee/logo.png)

Apache TomEE comes with four different flavors, Web Profile, JAX-RS, Plus and Plume.

-	Apache TomEE Web Profile delivers Servlets, JSP, JSF, JTA, JPA, CDI, Bean Validation and EJB Lite.
-	Apache TomEE JAX-RS (RESTfull Services) delivers the Web Profile plus JAX-RS (RESTfull Services).
-	Apache TomEE Plus delivers all that is in the Web Profile and JAX-RS (RESTfull Services), plus EJB Full, Java EE Connector Architecture, JMS (Java Message Service) and JAX-WS (Web Services).
-	Apache TomEE Plume delivers all that is in the Plus Profile, but includes Mojarra and EclipseLink support.

All Dockerfile files of supported versions can be found at https://github.com/tomitribe/docker-tomee

# How to use this image.

Run the default TomEE server (`CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]`):

```console
$ docker run -it --rm arm32v7/tomee:<java-version>\-<tomeeversion>\-<flavour>
```

For example running Apache TomEE 1.7.2 with JRE 8 and Webprofile flavour will be:

```console
$ docker run -it --rm arm32v7/tomee:8-jre-1.7.2-webprofile
```

You can test it by visiting `http://container-ip:8080` in a browser or, if you need access outside the host, on port 8888:

```console
$ docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8080 arm32v7/tomee:<java-version>\-<tomeeversion>\-<flavour>
```

You can then go to `http://localhost:8888` or `http://host-ip:8888` in a browser.

The configuration files are available in `/usr/local/tomee/conf/`. By default, no user is included in the "manager-gui" role required to operate the "/manager/html" web application. If you wish to use this app, you must define such a user in `tomcat-users.xml`.

You can also use this image as base image for deploying your war application. To do it you need to create a Dockerfile based on Tomee Docker image and add the war file in `webapps` directory:

```dockerfile
COPY <locationofapplication>/<warfile> /usr/local/tomee/webapps/<warfile>
```
