## `%%IMAGE%%:<version>-fpm`

This variant contains PHP-FPM, which is a FastCGI implementation for PHP. See [the PHP-FPM website](https://php-fpm.org/) for more information about PHP-FPM.

In order to use this image variant, some kind of reverse proxy (such as NGINX, Apache, or other tool which speaks the FastCGI protocol) will be required.
