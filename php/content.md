# What is PHP?

PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development, but which
can also be used as a general-purpose programming language. PHP can be added to
straight HTML or it can be used with a variety of templating engines and web
frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by an interpreter, which is either
implemented as a native module on the web-server or as a common gateway
interface (CGI).

# How to use this image.

## With Command Line

For PHP projects run through the command line interface (CLI), you can do the
following.

### Create a `Dockerfile` in your PHP project

    FROM php:5.6-cli
    COPY . /usr/src/myapp
    WORKDIR /usr/src/myapp
    CMD [ "php", "./your-script.php" ]

Then, run the commands to build and run the Docker image:

    docker build -t my-php-app .
    docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-php-app

### Run a single PHP script

For many simple, single file projects, you may find it inconvenient to write a
complete `Dockerfile`. In such cases, you can run a PHP script by using the PHP
Docker image directly:

    docker run -it --rm --name my-running-script -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp php:5.6-cli php your-script.php

## With Apache

More commonly, you will probably want to run PHP in conjunction with Apache
httpd. Conveniently, there's a version of the PHP container that's packaged with
the Apache web server.

### Create a `Dockerfile` in your PHP project

    FROM php:5.6-apache
    COPY src/ /var/www/html/

Where `src/` is the directory containing all your php code. Then, run the commands to build and run the Docker image:

    docker build -t my-php-app .
    docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-php-app

We recommend that you add a custom `php.ini` configuration. `COPY` it into
`/usr/local/lib` by adding one more line to the Dockerfile above and running the
same commands to build and run:

    FROM php:5.6-apache
    COPY config/php.ini /usr/local/lib/
    COPY src/ /var/www/html/

Where `src/` is the directory containing all your php code and `config/`
contains your `php.ini` file.

### How to install more PHP extensions

We provide two convenient scripts named `docker-php-ext-configure` and `docker-php-ext-install`, you can use them to
easily install PHP extension.

For example, if you want to have a PHP-FPM image with `iconv`, `mcrypt` and `gd` 
extensions, you can inheriting the base image that you like, and write your own 
`Dockerfile` like this:

    FROM php:5.5-fpm
    # Install modules
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
        libmcrypt-dev libpng12-dev libfreetype6-dev libjpeg62-turbo-dev \
        && docker-php-ext-install iconv mcrypt \
        && docker-php-ext-configure gd --with-freetype-dir=/usr/include/ --with-gd-dir=/usr/include/ \
        && docker-php-ext-install gd
    CMD ["php-fpm"]

Remember, you must install dependencies for your extensions manually. If an extension needs custom `configure` arguments,
you can use the `docker-php-ext-configure` script like this example.

### Without a `Dockerfile`

If you don't want to include a `Dockerfile` in your project, it is sufficient to
do the following:

    docker run -it --rm --name my-apache-php-app -v "$PWD":/var/www/html php:5.6-apache
