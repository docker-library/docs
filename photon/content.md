# VMware Photon OS

%%LOGO%%

Photon OS is a technology preview of a minimal Linux container host. It is designed to have a small footprint and boot extremely quickly on VMware platforms. Photon OS is intended to invite collaboration around running containerized applications in a virtualized environment.

Photon contains `tdnf`, a new, open-source, yum-compatible package manager that will help make the system as small as possible, but preserve the robust yum package management capabilities.

See the [FAQ](http://vmware.github.io/photon/assets/files/photon_faqs.pdf) for more information.

## How to use these images

Photon OS images are intended for use in the **FROM** field of an application's `Dockerfile`. For example, to use VMware Photon 1.0RC as the base of an image, specify `FROM photon:1.0RC`.

## Support

Photon OS is released as open source software and comes with no commercial support.

But since we want to ensure success and recognize that Photon OSâ„¢ consumers might fall into a range of roles - from developers that are steeped in the conventions of open-source to customers that are more accustomed to VMware commercial offerings, we offer several methods of engaging with the Photon OS team and community.
