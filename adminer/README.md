# Adminer

## What is Adminer?

Adminer (formerly phpMinAdmin) is a full-featured database management tool written in PHP. Conversely to phpMyAdmin, it consist of a single file ready to deploy to the target server. Adminer is available for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MS SQL, Oracle, Firebird, SimpleDB, Elasticsearch and MongoDB.

## How to use this image

### Standalone

	$ docker run --link some_database:db -p 8080:8080 adminer

Then you can hit `http://localhost:8080` or `http://host-ip:8080` in your browser.

### FastCGI

If you are already running a FastCGI capable web server you might prefer running adminer via FastCGI:

	$ docker run --link some_database:db -p 9000:9000 adminer:fastcgi

Then point your web server to port 9000 of the container.

Note: This exposes the FastCGI socket to the Internet. Make sure to add proper firewall rules or use a private Docker network instead to prevent a direct access.

## Supported Drivers

While Adminer supports a wide range of database drivers this image only supports the following out of the box:

-	MySQL
-	PostgreSQL
-	SQLite
-	SimpleDB
-	Elasticsearch

To add support for the other drivers you will need to install the following PHP extensions on top of this image:

-	oci8 (Oracle)
-	interbase (Firebird)
-	mongo (MongoDB)
