# Adminer

## What is Adminer?

Adminer (formerly phpMinAdmin) is a full-featured database management tool written in PHP. Conversely to phpMyAdmin, it consist of a single file ready to deploy to the target server. Adminer is available for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MS SQL, Oracle, Firebird, SimpleDB, Elasticsearch and MongoDB.

## How to use this image

### Standalone

```console
$ docker run --link some_database:db -p 8080:8080 s390x/adminer
```

Then you can hit `http://localhost:8080` or `http://host-ip:8080` in your browser.

### FastCGI

If you are already running a FastCGI capable web server you might prefer running Adminer via FastCGI:

```console
$ docker run --link some_database:db -p 9000:9000 s390x/adminer:fastcgi
```

Then point your web server to port 9000 of the container.

Note: This exposes the FastCGI socket to the Internet. Make sure to add proper firewall rules or use a private Docker network instead to prevent a direct access.

### ... via [`docker stack deploy`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stack_deploy/) or [`docker-compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose)

Example `stack.yml` for `adminer`:

```yaml
# Use root/example as user/password credentials

version: '3.1'

services:

    adminer:
        image: adminer
        restart: always
        ports:
            - 8080:8080

    db:
        image: mysql:5.6
        restart: always
        environment:
            MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
```

[![Try in PWD](https://github.com/play-with-docker/stacks/raw/cff22438cb4195ace27f9b15784bbb497047afa7/assets/images/button.png)](http://play-with-docker.com?stack=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker-library/docs/e24f39cddf21560cf0a24f149059ff23640b0f16/adminer/stack.yml)

Run `docker stack deploy -c stack.yml adminer` (or `docker-compose -f stack.yml up`), wait for it to initialize completely, and visit `http://swarm-ip:8080`, `http://localhost:8080`, or `http://host-ip:8080` (as appropriate).

### Loading plugins

This image bundles all official Adminer plugins. You can find the list of plugins on GitHub: https://github.com/vrana/adminer/tree/master/plugins.

To load plugins you can pass a list of filenames in `ADMINER_PLUGINS`:

```console
$ docker run --link some_database:db -p 8080:8080 -e ADMINER_PLUGINS='tables-filter tinymce' s390x/adminer
```

If a plugin *requires* parameters to work correctly you will need to add a custom file to the container:

```console
$ docker run --link some_database:db -p 8080:8080 -e ADMINER_PLUGINS='login-servers' s390x/adminer
Unable to load plugin file "login-servers", because it has required parameters: servers
Create a file "/var/www/html/plugins-enabled/login-servers.php" with the following contents to load the plugin:

<?php
require_once('plugins/login-servers.php');

/** Set supported servers
    * @param array array($domain) or array($domain => $description) or array($category => array())
    * @param string
    */
return new AdminerLoginServers(
    $servers = ???,
    $driver = 'server'
);
```

To load a custom plugin you can add PHP scripts that return the instance of the plugin object to `/var/www/html/plugins-enabled/`.

### Choosing a design

The image bundles all the designs that are available in the source package of adminer. You can find the list of designs on GitHub: https://github.com/vrana/adminer/tree/master/designs.

To use a bundled design you can pass its name in `ADMINER_DESIGN`:

```console
$ docker run --link some_database:db -p 8080:8080 -e ADMINER_DESIGN='nette' s390x/adminer
```

To use a custom design you can add a file called `/var/www/html/adminer.css`.

## Supported Drivers

While Adminer supports a wide range of database drivers this image only supports the following out of the box:

-	MySQL
-	PostgreSQL
-	SQLite
-	SimpleDB
-	Elasticsearch

To add support for the other drivers you will need to install the following PHP extensions on top of this image:

-	`pdo_dblib` (MS SQL)
-	`oci8` (Oracle)
-	`interbase` (Firebird)

The following drivers are not supported by this image:

-	MongoDB (The driver is not supported by PHP 7)
