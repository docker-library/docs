# Adminer

## What is Adminer?

Adminer (formerly phpMinAdmin) is a full-featured database management tool written in PHP. Conversely to phpMyAdmin, it consist of a single file ready to deploy to the target server. Adminer is available for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MS SQL, Oracle, Firebird, SimpleDB, Elasticsearch and MongoDB.

## How to use this image

### Standalone

```console
$ docker run --link some_database:db -p 8080:8080 %%IMAGE%%
```

Then you can hit `http://localhost:8080` or `http://host-ip:8080` in your browser.

### FastCGI

If you are already running a FastCGI capable web server you might prefer running Adminer via FastCGI:

```console
$ docker run --link some_database:db -p 9000:9000 %%IMAGE%%:fastcgi
```

Then point your web server to port 9000 of the container.

Note: This exposes the FastCGI socket to the Internet. Make sure to add proper firewall rules or use a private Docker network instead to prevent a direct access.

### %%STACK%%

Run `docker stack deploy -c stack.yml %%REPO%%` (or `docker-compose -f stack.yml up`), wait for it to initialize completely, and visit `http://swarm-ip:8080`, `http://localhost:8080`, or `http://host-ip:8080` (as appropriate).

### Loading plugins

This image bundles all official Adminer plugins. You can find the list of plugins on GitHub: https://github.com/vrana/adminer/tree/master/plugins.

To load plugins you can pass a list of filenames in `ADMINER_PLUGINS`:

```console
$ docker run --link some_database:db -p 8080:8080 -e ADMINER_PLUGINS='tables-filter tinymce' %%IMAGE%%
```

If a plugin *requires* parameters to work correctly you will need to add a custom file to the container:

```console
$ docker run --link some_database:db -p 8080:8080 -e ADMINER_PLUGINS='login-servers' %%IMAGE%%
Unable to load plugin file "login-servers", because it has required parameters: servers
Create a file "/var/www/html/plugins-enabled/login-servers.php" with the following contents to load the plugin:

<?php
require_once('plugins/login-servers.php');

/** Set supported servers
    * @param array array($domain) or array($domain => $description) or array($category => array())
    * @param string
    */
return new AdminerLoginServers(
    $servers = ???,
    $driver = 'server'
);
```

To load a custom plugin you can add PHP scripts that return the instance of the plugin object to `/var/www/html/plugins-enabled/`.

### Choosing a design

The image bundles all the designs that are available in the source package of adminer. You can find the list of designs on GitHub: https://github.com/vrana/adminer/tree/master/designs.

To use a bundled design you can pass its name in `ADMINER_DESIGN`:

```console
$ docker run --link some_database:db -p 8080:8080 -e ADMINER_DESIGN='nette' %%IMAGE%%
```

To use a custom design you can add a file called `/var/www/html/adminer.css`.

### Usage with external server

You can specify the default host with the `ADMINER_DEFAULT_SERVER` environment variable. This is useful if you are connecting to an external server or a docker container named something other than the default `db`.

```console
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e ADMINER_DEFAULT_SERVER=mysql %%IMAGE%%
```

## Supported Drivers

While Adminer supports a wide range of database drivers this image only supports the following out of the box:

-	MySQL
-	PostgreSQL
-	SQLite
-	SimpleDB
-	Elasticsearch

To add support for the other drivers you will need to install the following PHP extensions on top of this image:

-	`pdo_dblib` (MS SQL)
-	`oci8` (Oracle)
-	`interbase` (Firebird)
-	`mongodb` (MongoDB)
