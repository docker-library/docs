[GitHub](%%GITHUB-REPO%%/issues); The [adoptium support](https://adoptium.net/support) page has more information on quality, roadmap and support levels for Eclipse Temurin builds. Vulnerabilities not related to Eclipse Temurin itself should be be raised to their respective projects (e.g Ubuntu vulnerabilities need to be raised directly to the Ubuntu project).
