## Getting Started

Aerospike Database Community Edition (CE) supports the same developer APIs as Aerospike Database Enterprise Edition (EE), except for durable deletes. They differ in ease of operation and [enterprise features](https://aerospike.com/products/features-and-editions/), such as compression.

Since server version 6.1, Aerospike EE starts in a single-node cluster evaluation mode, with all its enterprise features available.

### Running an Aerospike Server node

#### Enterprise Edition

By using Aerospike Enterprise Edition you agree to the [ENTERPRISE_LICENSE](enterprise/ENTERPRISE_LICENSE).

```sh
docker run -d --name aerospike -p 3000-3002:3000-3002 %%IMAGE%%:ee-[version]
```

Running Enterprise Edition with a feature key file in a mapped directory:

```sh
docker run -d -v DIR:/opt/aerospike/etc/ -e "FEATURE_KEY_FILE=/opt/aerospike/etc/features.conf" --name aerospike -p 3000-3002:3000-3002 %%IMAGE%%:ee-[version]
```

Running Enterprise Edition with a feature key file in an environment variable:

```sh
docker run -d -v DIR:/opt/aerospike/etc/ -e "FEATURE_KEY_FILE=/opt/aerospike/etc/features.conf" --name aerospike -p 3000-3002:3000-3002 %%IMAGE%%:ee-[version]
```

Above, _DIR_ is a directory on your machine where you drop your feature key file. Make sure Docker Desktop has file sharing permission to bind mount it into Docker containers.

#### Community Edition

By using Aerospike Community Edition you agree to the [COMMUNITY_LICENSE](community/COMMUNITY_LICENSE).

Running Aerospike Community Edition:

```sh
docker run -d --name aerospike -p 3000-3002:3000-3002 %%IMAGE%%:ce-[version]

## Customizing the Default Developer Environment

The Aerospike Docker image comes with a default configuration file, which sets up a single node, single namespace developer environment. Alternatively, you can provide your own configuration file (see below).

You can inject parameters into the default configuration template using container-side environment variables with the `-e` flag.

For example, to set the default [namespace](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/architecture/data-model) name to _demo_:

```sh
docker run -d --name aerospike -e "NAMESPACE=demo" -p 3000-3002:3000-3002 -v /my/dir:/opt/aerospike/etc/ -e "FEATURE_KEY_FILE=/opt/aerospike/etc/features.conf" %%IMAGE%%:ee-[version]
```

Injecting configuration parameters into the configuration template isn't compatible with providing a configuration file. You can use one or the other.

### List of template variables

#### `FEATURE_KEY_FILE`

The [`feature_key_file`](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/operations/configure/feature-key). of the `service` context which is only applicable and to Enterprise editions and must be set to the empty string when running the Community edition. Default: _/etc/aerospike/features.conf_.

#### `LOGFILE`

The [`file`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#file) param of the `logging` context. Default: _""_, do not log to file. The container will also log to `stdout`` regardless of what is configured here.

#### `SERVICE_ADDRESS`

The bind [`address`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#address) of the `networking.service` subcontext. Default: _any_

#### `SERVICE_PORT`

The [`port`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#port) of the `networking.service` subcontext. Default: _3000_

### Preconfigured namespace

The single preconfigured namespace has the following variables:

#### `NAMESPACE`

The name of the namespace. Default: _test_

#### `DATA_IN_MEMORY`

The storage-engine [`data-in-memory`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#data-in-memory) setting. If _false_ (default), the namespace only stores the index in memory, and all
reads and writes are served [from the filesystem](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/operations/configure/namespace/storage#recipe-for-a-persistent-memory-storage-engine). If _true_ the namespace storage is [in-memory with filesystem persistence](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/operations/configure/namespace/storage#recipe-for-an-hdd-storage-engine-with-data-in-memory), meaning that reads and writes happen from a full in-memory copy, and a synchronous write persists to disk.

#### `DEFAULT_TTL`

The namespace [`default-ttl`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#default-ttl). Default: _30d_

#### `MEM_GB`

The namespace [`memory-size`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#memory-size). Default: _1_, the unit is always `G` (GB)

#### `NSUP_PERIOD`

The namespace [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period). Default: _120_ , nsup-period in seconds

#### `STORAGE_GB`

The namespace persistence `file` size. Default: _4_, the unit is always `G` (GB)

## Advanced Configuration

You can override the default configuration file by providing your own aerospike.conf, as described in [Configuring Aerospike Database](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/operations/configure).

You should first `-v` map a local directory, which Docker will bind mount. Next, drop your aerospike.conf file into this directory. Finally, use the `--config-file` option to tell Aerospike where in the container the configuration file is (the default path is _/etc/aerospike/aerospike.conf_). Remember that the feature key file is required, so use `feature-key-file` in your config file to point to a mounted path (such as _/opt/aerospike/etc/feature.conf_).

For example:

```sh
docker run -d -v /opt/aerospike/etc/:/opt/aerospike/etc/ --name aerospike -p 3000-3002:3000-3002 %%IMAGE%%:ee-[version] --config-file /opt/aerospike/etc/aerospike.conf
```

### Persistent data directory

With Docker, the files within the container are not persisted past the life of the container. To persist data, you will want to mount a directory from the host to the container's _/opt/aerospike/data_ using the `-v` option:

For example:

```sh
docker run -d  -v /opt/aerospike/data:/opt/aerospike/data  -v /opt/aerospike/etc:/opt/aerospike/etc/ --name aerospike -p 3000-3002:3000-3002 -e "FEATURE_KEY_FILE=/opt/aerospike/etc/features.conf" %%IMAGE%%:ee-[version]
```

The example above uses the configuration template, where the single defined namespace is in-memory with file-based persistence. Just mounting the predefined _/opt/aerospike/data_ directory enables the data to be persisted on the host.

Alternatively, your custom configuration file is used with the parameter `file` set to be a file in the mounted _/opt/aerospike/data_, such as in the following config snippet:

```plaintext
namespace test {
    # :
    storage-engine device {
        file /opt/aerospike/data/test.dat
        filesize 4G
        data-in-memory true
    }
}
```

In this example we also mount the data directory in a similar way, using a custom configuration file

```sh
docker run -d -v /opt/aerospike/data:/opt/aerospike/data -v /opt/aerospike/etc/:/opt/aerospike/etc/ --name aerospike -p 3000-3002:3000-3002 --config-file /opt/aerospike/etc/aerospike.conf %%IMAGE%%:ee-[version]
```

### Block storage

Docker provides an ability to expose a host's block devices to a running container. The `--device` option can be used to map a host block device within a container.

Update the `storage-engine device` section of the namespace in the custom Aerospike configuration file.

```plaintext
namespace test {
    # :
    storage-engine device {
        device /dev/xvdc
        write-block-size 128k
    }
}
```

Now to map a host drive /dev/sdc to /dev/xvdc on a container

```sh
docker run -d --device '/dev/sdc:/dev/xvdc' -v /opt/aerospike/etc/:/opt/aerospike/etc/ --name aerospike -p 3000-3002:3000-3002 --config-file /opt/aerospike/etc/aerospike.conf %%IMAGE%%:ee-[version]
```

### Persistent Lua cache

Upon restart, your Lua cache will become emptied. To persist the cache, you will want to mount a directory from the host to the container's _/opt/aerospike/usr/udf/lua_ using the `-v` option:

```sh
docker run -d -v /opt/aerospike/lua:/opt/aerospike/usr/udf/lua -v /opt/aerospike/data:/opt/aerospike/data --name aerospike -p 3000-3002:3000-3002 --config-file /opt/aerospike/etc/aerospike.conf %%IMAGE%%:ee-[version]
```

### A note about security

For convenience, this image does not have security turned on by default, but it is a core Aerospike Enterprise Edition feature. The knowledge base article [How To secure Aerospike database servers](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/how-to-secure-aerospike-database-servers/7804) covers the topic well.

[And Now for a Security Reminder](https://www.aerospike.com/blog/and-now-for-a-security-reminder/) that bad things can happen to good people.

Also see the knowledge base article [How To secure Aerospike database servers](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/how-to-secure-aerospike-database-servers/7804).

### Networking

Developers using the Aerospike Enterprise Edition single-node evaluation, and most others using Docker Desktop on their machine for development, will not need to configure the node for clustering. If you're interested in using clustering and have a feature key file without a single node limit or you are using the Community Edition, read the following sections.

#### Configuring the node's access address

In order for the Aerospike node to properly broadcast its address to the cluster and applications, the [`access-address`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#access-address) configuration parameter needs to be set in the configuration file. If it is not set, then the IP address within the container will be used, which is not accessible to other nodes.

```plaintext
    network {
        service {
            address any                  # Listening IP Address
            port 3000                    # Listening Port
            access-address 192.168.1.100 # IP Address used by cluster nodes and applications
        }

    ...
    }
```

#### Mesh clustering

See [How do I get a 2 nodes Aerospike cluster running quickly in Docker without editing a single file?](https://medium.com/aerospike-developer-blog/how-do-i-get-a-2-node-aerospike-cluster-running-quickly-in-docker-without-editing-a-single-file-1c2a94564a99?source=friends_link&sk=4ff6a22f0106596c42aa4b77d6cdc3a5)

## Sending Performance Data to Aerospike

Aerospike Telemetry is a feature that allows us to collect certain anonymized use data – not the database data – on your Aerospike Community Edition server use. We’d like to know when clusters are created and destroyed, cluster size, cluster workload, how often queries are run, whether instances are deployed purely in-memory or with Flash. Aerospike Telemetry collects information from running Community Edition server instances every 10 minutes. The data helps us to understand how the product is being used, identify issues, and create a better experience for the end user. [More Info](http://www.aerospike.com/aerospike-telemetry/)

## Image Versions

These images are based on [debian:bullseye-slim](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian).

### ee-[version]

These tags are for Aerospike EE images, and will require a feature key file, such as the one you get with the single-node EE evaluation, or one associated with a commercial enterprise license agreement.

### ce-[version]

These tags are for Aerospike CE images, and do not require a feature key file to start. As mentioned above, the developer API for both is the same, but the editions differ in operational features.
