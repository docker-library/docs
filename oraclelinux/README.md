# Oracle Linux

![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker-library/docs/master/oraclelinux/logo.png)

Oracle Linux is an open-source operating system available under the GNU General
Public License (GPLv2). Suitable for general purpose or Oracle workloads, it 
benefits from rigorous testing of more than 128,000 hours per day with real-
world workloads and includes unique innovations such as Ksplice for zero-
downtime kernel patching, DTrace for real-time diagnostics, the powerful Btrfs 
file system, and more.

## How to use these images

The Oracle Linux images are intended for use in the **FROM** field of an 
application's `Dockerfile`. For example, to use Oracle Linux 6 as the 
base of an image, specify `FROM oraclelinux:6`.
