# Oracle Linux

![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker-library/docs/9d0bc984117a35c4236e09ba1c6f4b2b9f287773/oraclelinux/logo.png)

Oracle Linux is an open-source operating system available under the GNU General Public License (GPLv2). Suitable for general purpose or Oracle workloads, it benefits from rigorous testing of more than 128,000 hours per day with real- world workloads and includes unique innovations such as Ksplice for zero- downtime kernel patching, DTrace for real-time diagnostics, the powerful Btrfs file system, and more.

## How to use these images

The Oracle Linux images are intended for use in the **FROM** field of a downstream `Dockerfile`. For example, to use the latest optimized Oracle Linux 7 image, specify `FROM oraclelinux:7-slim`.

## Removal of `latest` tag

The `latest` tag was removed from the Oracle Linux official images in June 2020 to reduce confusion. Downstream images using `oraclelinux:latest` or no tag should be updated to `oraclelinux:7` for future builds. Note that Oracle recommends using the `-slim` variants for the smallest possible image size.

## Customer Support

Oracle provides support to Oracle Linux subscription customers via the [My Oracle Support](https://support.oracle.com) portal. The Oracle Linux Docker images are covered by Oracle Linux Basic and Premier support subscriptions. Customers should follow existing support procedures to obtain support for Oracle Linux running in a Docker container.

This image is officially supported for Oracle Linux customers with an active Oracle Linux Basic or Premier support subscription on both Oracle Linux 6 and Oracle Linux 7 running the Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel Release 4 and Oracle Container Runtime for Docker installed from the Unbreakable Linux Network (ULN) or the Oracle Linux yum server.

Oracle Linux users without an active support subscription can use either the Oracle distributed version of Oracle Container Runtime for Docker or the upstream version distributed by Docker. Support is limited to the community-based options outlined below.

### Oracle Linux 7

Please review the [additional Linux programs supported under Oracle Linux support](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E52668_01/E63013/html/ol7-lic-addl-packages.html) chapter for more information on the scope of support for the Oracle Container Runtime for Docker.

Please review the [Oracle Container Runtime for Docker User's Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E52668_01/E87205/html/index.html) for details on how to install or upgrade the Oracle Container Runtime for Docker on Oracle Linux 7.

## Community Support

For Oracle Linux users without a paid support subscription, the following resources are available:
