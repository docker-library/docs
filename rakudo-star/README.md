# What is Rakudo Star?

Rakudo Star is a Raku (formerly known as Perl 6) distribution designed for use by early adopters of the language. It includes a virtual machine (the JVM or MoarVM), the Rakudo compiler, and a suite of modules that users may find useful. This image includes the MoarVM backend for the compiler.
