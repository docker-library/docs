# What is Rakudo Star?

Rakudo Star is a Perl 6 distribution designed for use by early adopters of the language. It includes a virtual machine (the JVM or MoarVM), the Rakudo Perl 6 compiler, and a suite of modules that users may find useful. This image includes the MoarVM backend for the compiler.

# How to use this image

Simply running a container with the image will launch a Perl 6 REPL:

```console
$ docker run -it %%IMAGE%%
> say 'Hello, Perl!'
Hello, Perl!
```

You can also provide perl6 command line switches to `docker run`:

```console
$ docker run -it %%IMAGE%% -e 'say "Hello!"'
```
