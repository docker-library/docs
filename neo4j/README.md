# What is Neo4j?

Neo4j is the world's leading graph database, with native graph storage and processing. You can learn more [here](http://neo4j.com/developer).

# How to use this image

You can start a Neo4j container like this:

```console
docker run \
    --publish=7474:7474 --publish=7687:7687 \
    --volume=$HOME/neo4j/data:/data \
    neo4j
```

which allows you to access neo4j through your browser at [http://localhost:7474](http://localhost:7474).

This binds two ports (`7474` and `7687`) for HTTP and Bolt access to the Neo4j API. A volume is bound to `/data` to allow the database to be persisted outside the container.

By default, this requires you to login with `neo4j/neo4j` and change the password. You can, for development purposes, disable authentication by passing `--env=NEO4J_AUTH=none` to docker run.
