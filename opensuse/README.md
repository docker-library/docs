# openSUSE

This project contains the stable releases of the openSUSE distribution.

# Naming conventions

Each image is tagged using both the release number (eg *"13.1"*) and the code
name (eg *"Bottle"*). The latest stable release is always available using the
"*latest*" tag.

# Building

These images are generated using [KIWI](https://github.com/openSUSE/kiwi). Their
source file can be found on [this
repository](https://github.com/openSUSE/docker-containers).

# Repositories and packages

The package selection is kept minimal to reduce the footprint of the image.

However the following repositories are already part of the image:

  * OSS
  * OSS Updates
  * Non-OSS
  * Non-OSS Updates

# Supported Docker versions

This image is officially supported on Docker version 1.4.1.

Support for older versions (down to 1.0) is provided on a best-effort basis.
