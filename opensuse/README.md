# openSUSE

This project contains the stable releases of the openSUSE distribution.

# Naming conventions

Each image is tagged using both the release number (eg *"13.1"*) and the code name (eg *"Bottle"*). The latest stable release is always available using the "*latest*" tag.

# Building

These images are generated using [KIWI](https://github.com/openSUSE/kiwi). Their source file can be found on [this repository](https://github.com/openSUSE/docker-containers).

# Repositories and packages

The package selection is kept minimal to reduce the footprint of the image.

However the following repositories are already part of the image:

-	OSS
-	OSS Updates
-	Non-OSS
-	Non-OSS Updates
