This image has been deprecated in favor of the [`opensuse/leap`](https://hub.docker.com/r/opensuse/leap) and [`opensuse/tumbleweed`](https://hub.docker.com/r/opensuse/tumbleweed) images provided and maintained by the [openSUSE Project](https://www.opensuse.org/) release team.

`opensuse:42.3` (= `opensuse:latest`) will receive security relevant fixes until the [EOL of Leap 42.3](https://en.opensuse.org/Lifetime#openSUSE_Leap). Newer openSUSE Leap releases such as 15.x are only available at [`opensuse/leap`](https://hub.docker.com/r/opensuse/leap).

The opensuse:tumbleweed image is no longer updated, please use [`opensuse/tumbleweed`](https://hub.docker.com/r/opensuse/tumbleweed) instead. [`opensuse/tumbleweed`](https://hub.docker.com/r/opensuse/tumbleweed) is updated on every snapshot release.

An archive for images of unsupported versions can be found at [`opensuse/archive`](https://hub.docker.com/r/opensuse/archive).
