This image is updated via [pull requests to the `docker-library/official-images` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/pulls?q=label%3Alibrary%2Fdebian).

For detailed information about the virtual/transfer sizes and individual layers of each of the above supported tags, please see [the `repos/debian/tag-details.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info/blob/master/repos/debian/tag-details.md) in [the `docker-library/repo-info` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info).

# What is Debian?

Debian is an operating system which is composed primarily of free and open-source software, most of which is under the GNU General Public License, and developed by a group of individuals known as the Debian project. Debian is one of the most popular Linux distributions for personal computers and network servers, and has been used as a base for several other Linux distributions.

# About this image

The `debian:latest` tag will always point the latest stable release (which is, at the time of this writing, `debian:jessie`). Stable releases are also tagged with their version (ie, `debian:8` is an alias for `debian:jessie`, `debian:7` is an alias for `debian:wheezy`, etc).

The rolling tags (`debian:stable`, `debian:testing`, etc) use the rolling suite names in their `/etc/apt/sources.list` file (ie, `deb http://deb.debian.org/debian testing main`).

The mirror of choice for these images is [the deb.debian.org CDN pointer/redirector](https://deb.debian.org) so that it's as reliable as possible for the largest subset of users (and is also the default mirror for `debootstrap` as of [2016-10-20](https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/d-i/debootstrap.git/commit/?id=9e8bc60ad1ccf3a25ce7890526b70059f3e770de)). See the [deb.debian.org homepage](https://deb.debian.org) for more information.

If you find yourself needing a Debian release which is EOL (and thus only available from [archive.debian.org](http://archive.debian.org)), you should check out [the `debian/eol` image](https://hub.docker.com/r/debian/eol/), which includes tags for Debian releases as far back as Potato (Debian 2.2), the first release to fully utilize APT.

## Locales

Given that it is a faithful "minbase" install of Debian, this image only includes the `C`, `C.UTF-8`, and `POSIX` locales by default. For most uses requiring a UTF-8 locale, `C.UTF-8` is likely sufficient (`-e LANG=C.UTF-8` or `ENV LANG C.UTF-8`).

For uses where that is not sufficient, other locales can be installed/generated via the `locales` package. [PostgreSQL has a good example of doing so](https://github.com/docker-library/postgres/blob/69bc540ecfffecce72d49fa7e4a46680350037f9/9.6/Dockerfile#L21-L24), copied below:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y locales && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
	&& localedef -i en_US -c -f UTF-8 -A /usr/share/locale/locale.alias en_US.UTF-8
ENV LANG en_US.utf8
```

## `<suite>-slim` variants

These tags are an experiment in providing a slimmer base (removing some extra files that are normally not necessary within containers, such as man pages and documentation), and are definitely subject to change.

See [the discussion in tianon/docker-brew-debian#48](https://github.com/tianon/docker-brew-debian/issues/48) for some notes/details regarding the specifics of the implementation.

## How It's Made

If you are curious about what goes into creating this image, please see [`contrib/mkimage.sh` in `github.com/docker/docker`](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/contrib/mkimage.sh) (and [`contrib/mkimage/debootstrap` in the same repo](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/contrib/mkimage/debootstrap)). Those are invoked by [`update.sh` in the image repository](https://github.com/tianon/docker-brew-debian/blob/master/update.sh), which provides some additional functionality such as generating `<suite>-backports` contents and repacking the generated tarballs for the `<suite>-slim` variants.

Additional interesting information is provided in files on the [relevant `dist` branch](https://github.com/tianon/docker-brew-debian/branches) of the image repository, namely the exact command used to build (`SUITE/build-command.txt`), a full log of the build itself (`SUITE/build.log`), and the "build manifest" (`SUITE/build.manifest`, which lists the version numbers of all the packages included in the rootfs tarball).

# Supported Docker versions

This image is officially supported on Docker version 1.12.3.

Support for older versions (down to 1.6) is provided on a best-effort basis.

Please see [the Docker installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) for details on how to upgrade your Docker daemon.
