# What is GeoNetwork?

GeoNetwork is a catalog application to **manage spatially referenced resources**. It provides powerful **metadata editing** and **search** functions as well as an interactive **web map viewer**.

The GeoNetwork project started out in year 2001 as a Spatial Data Catalogue System for the Food and Agriculture organisation of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP).

At present the project is widely used as the basis of **Spatial Data Infrastructures** all around the world.

GeoNetwork has been developed to connect spatial information communities and their data using a modern architecture, which is at the same time powerful and low cost, based on the principles of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and International and Open Standards for services and protocols (e.g.: ISO/TC211, OGC).

The project is part of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation ( [OSGeo](http://www.osgeo.org/) ) and can be found at [GeoNetwork opensource](http://www.geonetwork-opensource.org). GeoNetwork has been developed to connect spatial information communities and their data using a modern architecture, which is at the same time powerful and low cost.

# How to use this image

## Start geonetwork

This command will start a debian-based container, running a Tomcat web server, with a geonetwork war deployed on the server:

```console
$ docker run --name some-geonetwork -d geonetwork
```

## Publish port

Geonetwork listens on port `8080`. If you want to access the container at the host, **you must publish this port**. For instance, this, will redirect all the container traffic on port 8080, to the same port on the host:

```console
$ docker run --name some-geonetwork -d -p 8080:8080 geonetwork
```

Then, if you are running docker on Linux, you may access geonetwork at http://localhost:8080/geonetwork. Otherwise, replace `localhost` by the address of your docker machine.

## Set the data directory

The data directory is the location on the file system where the catalog stores much of its custom configuration and uploaded files. It is also where it stores a number of support files, used for various purposes (e.g.: Lucene index, spatial index, thumbnails).

By default, geonetwork sets the data directory on `/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/geonetwork/WEB-INF/data`, but you may override this value by injecting an environment variable into the container: - `-e DATA_DIR=...` (defaults to `/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/geonetwork/WEB-INF/data`)

For instance, to set the data directory to `/var/lib/geonetwork_data`:

```console
$ docker run --name some-geonetwork -d -p 8080:8080 -e DATA_DIR=/var/lib/geonetwork_data geonetwork
```

## Persist data

If you want the data directory to live beyond restarts, or even destruction of the container, you can mount a directory from the docker engine's host into the container. - `-v <host path>:<data directory>`. For instance this, will mount the host directory `/host/geonetwork-docker` into `/var/lib/geonetwork_data` on the container:

```console
$ docker run --name some-geonetwork -d -p 8080:8080 -e DATA_DIR=/var/lib/geonetwork_data -v /host/geonetwork-docker:/var/lib/geonetwork_data geonetwork
```

## ... via [`docker stack deploy`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stack_deploy/) or [`docker-compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose)

Example `stack.yml` for `geonetwork`:

```yaml
# GeoNetwork
#
# Access via "http://localhost:8080/geonetwork" (or "http://$(docker-machine ip):8080/geonetwork" if using docker-machine)
#
# Default user: admin
# Default password: admin

version: '3.1'
services:

  geonetwork:
    image: geonetwork
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    environment:
      DATA_DIR: /var/lib/geonetwork_data
    volumes:
      - geonetwork:/var/lib/geonetwork_data

volumes:
  geonetwork:
```

[![Try in PWD](https://github.com/play-with-docker/stacks/raw/cff22438cb4195ace27f9b15784bbb497047afa7/assets/images/button.png)](http://play-with-docker.com?stack=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker-library/docs/9efeec18b6b2ed232cf0fbd3914b6211e16e242c/geonetwork/stack.yml)

Run `docker stack deploy -c stack.yml geonetwork` (or `docker-compose -f stack.yml up`), wait for it to initialize completely, and visit `http://swarm-ip:8080/geonetwork`, `http://localhost:8080/geonetwork`, or `http://host-ip:8080/geonetwork` (as appropriate).

## Default credentials

After installation a default user with name `admin` and password `admin` is created. Use this credentials to start with. It is recommended to update the default password after installation.

# Image Variants

The `geonetwork` images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific use case.

## `geonetwork:<version>`

This is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both as a throw away container (mount your source code and start the container to start your app), as well as the base to build other images off of.

By default, an H2 database is configured and created when the application first starts. If you are interested in a database engine other than H2, please have a look at other image variants.

## `geonetwork:postgres`

This image gives support for using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as database engine for geonetwork. When you start the container, a database is created, and it is populated by geonetwork, once it starts.

Please note that this image **does not ship** the postgres database server itself, but it gives you the option to link to a container running postgres, or to connect to a postgres instance using its ip address. If you are looking for a self-contained installation of geonetwork, **including the database engine**, please have a look at the default image variant.

In order to setup the connection from geonetwork, you **must** inject the following variables into the container: - `POSTGRES_DB_USERNAME`: postgres user on your database server (must have permission to create databases) - `POSTGRES_DB_PASSWORD`: postgres password on your database server

If your postgres instance is listening on a non-standard port, you must also set that variable: - `POSTGRES_DB_PORT`: postgres port on your database server (defaults to `5432`)

### Connecting to a postgres database

If you want to connect to a postgres server, you need to pass an extra environment variable, `POSTGRES_DB_HOST`, containing the address of this server.

If you want to connect to an **external database server**, you can use either the IP address or the DNS as `POSTGRES_DB_HOST`. For instance, if the server is running on `mydns.net`, on port `5434`, the username is `postgres` and the password is `mysecretpassword`:

```console
$ docker run --name geonetwork -d -p 8080:8080 -e POSTGRES_DB_HOST=mydns.net -e POSTGRES_DB_PORT=5434 -e POSTGRES_DB_USERNAME=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword geonetwork:postgres
```

If are want to **run postgres on a container**, you can use the container name as `POSTGRES_DB_HOST`: just make sure that containers can discover each other, by **running them in the same user-defined network**. For instance, you can create a bridge network:

```console
$ docker network create --driver bridge mynet
```

Then if you want to run the official image of postgres, using `some-postgres` as container name, you could launch it like this:

```console
$ docker run --name some-postgres --network=mynet -d postgres
```

And then you could launch geonetwork, making sure you join the same network, and setting the required environment variables, including the `POSTGRES_DB_HOST`:

```console
$ docker run --name geonetwork -d -p 8080:8080 --network=mynet -e POSTGRES_DB_HOST=some-postgres -e POSTGRES_DB_PORT=5432 -e POSTGRES_DB_USERNAME=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword geonetwork:postgres
```
