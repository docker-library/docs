# What is HAProxy?

HAProxy is a free, open source high availability solution, providing load balancing and proxying for TCP and HTTP-based applications by spreading requests across multiple servers. It is written in C and has a reputation for being fast and efficient (in terms of processor and memory usage).

# How to use this image

Since no two users of HAProxy are likely to configure it exactly alike, this image does not come with any default configuration.

Please refer to [upstream's excellent (and comprehensive) documentation](https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/) on the subject of configuring HAProxy for your needs.

It is also worth checking out the [`examples/` directory from upstream](http://www.haproxy.org/git?p=haproxy-1.5.git;a=tree;f=examples).

Note: Many configuration examples propose to put `daemon` into the `global` section to run haproxy as daemon. Do **not** configure this or the Docker container will exit immediately after launching because the haproxy process would go into the background.

## Create a `Dockerfile`

	FROM haproxy:1.5
	COPY haproxy.cfg /usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg

## Test the configuration file	
	docker run -it --rm  --name my-running-haproxy -v /path/to/haproxy.cfg:/usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg:ro haproxy:1.5 haproxy -c -f /usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
	
## Build and run

	docker build -t my-haproxy .
	docker run -d --name my-running-haproxy my-haproxy

## Directly via bind mount

	docker run -d --name my-running-haproxy -v /path/to/haproxy.cfg:/usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg:ro haproxy:1.5
