# What is Logstash?

Logstash is an open source data collection engine with real-time pipelining capabilities. Logstash can dynamically unify data from disparate sources and normalize the data into destinations of your choice.

Collection is accomplished via a number of configurable input plugins including raw socket/packet communication, file tailing and several message bus clients. Once an input plugin has collected data it can be processed by any number of filters which modify and annotate the event data. Finally, events are routed to output plugins which can forward the events to a variety of external programs including Elasticsearch, local files and several message bus implementations.
