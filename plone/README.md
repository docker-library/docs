# What is Plone?

[Plone](https://plone.org) is a free and open source content management system built on top of the Zope application server.

![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker-library/docs/57d4b2b366f7243810393fa6018bd8b62926b78d/plone/logo.svg?sanitize=true)

## Features

-	Images for Plone 5.x and Plone 4.x
-	Enable add-ons via environment variables
-	Choose between [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) or [Alpine](http://www.alpinelinux.org/) based images.

## Usage

### Start a single Plone instance

This will download and start the latest Plone 5 container, based on [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).

```console
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 plone
```

This image includes `EXPOSE 8080` (the Plone port), so standard container linking will make it automatically available to the linked containers. Now you can add a Plone Site at http://localhost:8080 - default Zope user and password are `admin/admin`.

### Start Plone within a ZEO cluster

ZEO cluster are best suited for production setups, you will **need** a loadbalancer.

Start ZEO server in the background

```console
$ docker run --name=zeo plone zeo
```

Start 2 Plone clients (also in the background)

```console
$ docker run --link=zeo -e ZEO_ADDRESS=zeo:8080 -p 8081:8080 plone
$ docker run --link=zeo -e ZEO_ADDRESS=zeo:8080 -p 8082:8080 plone
```

### Start Plone in debug mode

You can also start Plone in debug mode (`fg`) by running

```console
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 plone fg
```

### Add-ons

You can enable Plone add-ons via the `ADDONS` environment variable

```console
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -e PLONE_ADDONS="eea.facetednavigation Products.PloneFormGen" plone
```

For more information on how to extend this image with your own custom settings, adding more add-ons, building it or mounting volumes, please refer to our [documentation](https://docs.plone.org/manage/docker/docs/index.html)

## Supported Environment Variables

The Plone image uses several environment variable that allow to specify a more specific setup.

### For Basic Usage

-	`ADDONS` - Customize Plone via Plone add-ons using this environment variable
-	`ZEO_ADDRESS` - This environment variable allows you to run Plone image as a ZEO client.

Run Plone with ZEO and install two addons (PloneFormGen and collective.roster)

```console
$ docker run --name=instance1 --link=zeo -e ZEO_ADDRESS=zeo:8080 -p 8080:8080 \
-e ADDONS="Products.PloneFormGen collective.roster" plone
```

To use specific add-ons versions:

```console
 -e ADDONS="Products.PloneFormGen==1.8.5 collective.roster==2.3.1"
```

### For Advanced Usage

-	`PLONE_ZCML`, `ZCML` - Include custom Plone add-ons ZCML files (former `BUILDOUT_ZCML`)
-	`PLONE_DEVELOP`, `DEVELOP` - Develop new or existing Plone add-ons (former `BUILDOUT_DEVELOP`)
-	`ZEO_READ_ONLY` - Run Plone as a read-only ZEO client. Defaults to `off`.
-	`ZEO_CLIENT_READ_ONLY_FALLBACK` - A flag indicating whether a read-only remote storage should be acceptable as a fallback when no writable storages are available. Defaults to `false`.
-	`ZEO_SHARED_BLOB_DIR` - Set this to on if the ZEO server and the instance have access to the same directory. Defaults to `off`.
-	`ZEO_STORAGE` - Set the storage number of the ZEO storage. Defaults to `1`.
-	`ZEO_CLIENT_CACHE_SIZE` - Set the size of the ZEO client cache. Defaults to `128MB`.
-	`ZEO_PACK_KEEP_OLD` - Can be set to false to disable the creation of `*.fs.old` files before the pack is run. Defaults to true.
-	`HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT` - Time in seconds to wait until health check starts. Defaults to `1` second.
-	`HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL` - Interval in seconds to check that the Zope application is still healthy. Defaults to `1` second.

# Image Variants

The `plone` images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific use case.

## `plone:<version>`

This is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both as a throw away container (mount your source code and start the container to start your app), as well as the base to build other images off of.

## `plone:<version>-alpine`

This image is based on the popular [Alpine Linux project](http://alpinelinux.org), available in [the `alpine` official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine). Alpine Linux is much smaller than most distribution base images (~5MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images in general.

This variant is highly recommended when final image size being as small as possible is desired. The main caveat to note is that it does use [musl libc](http://www.musl-libc.org) instead of [glibc and friends](http://www.etalabs.net/compare_libcs.html), so certain software might run into issues depending on the depth of their libc requirements. However, most software doesn't have an issue with this, so this variant is usually a very safe choice. See [this Hacker News comment thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10782897) for more discussion of the issues that might arise and some pro/con comparisons of using Alpine-based images.

To minimize image size, it's uncommon for additional related tools (such as `git` or `bash`) to be included in Alpine-based images. Using this image as a base, add the things you need in your own Dockerfile (see the [`alpine` image description](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) for examples of how to install packages if you are unfamiliar).
