# What is Plone?

[Plone](https://plone.org) is a free and open source content management system built on top of the Zope application server.

%%LOGO%%

## Features

-	Images for Plone 5.x and Plone 4.x
-	Enable add-ons via environment variables
-	Choose between [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) or [Alpine](http://www.alpinelinux.org/) based images.

## Usage

### Start a single Plone instance

This will download and start the latest Plone 5 container, based on [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).

```console
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 %%IMAGE%%
```

This image includes `EXPOSE 8080` (the Plone port), so standard container linking will make it automatically available to the linked containers. Now you can add a Plone Site at http://localhost:8080 - default Zope user and password are `admin/admin`.

### Start Plone within a ZEO cluster

ZEO cluster are best suited for production setups, you will **need** a loadbalancer.

Start ZEO server in the background

```console
$ docker run --name=zeo %%IMAGE%% zeo
```

Start 2 Plone clients (also in the background)

```console
$ docker run --link=zeo -e ZEO_ADDRESS=zeo:8080 -p 8081:8080 %%IMAGE%%
$ docker run --link=zeo -e ZEO_ADDRESS=zeo:8080 -p 8082:8080 %%IMAGE%%
```

### Start Plone in debug mode

You can also start Plone in debug mode (`fg`) by running

```console
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 %%IMAGE%% fg
```

### Add-ons

You can enable Plone add-ons via the `ADDONS` environment variable

```console
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -e PLONE_ADDONS="eea.facetednavigation Products.PloneFormGen" %%IMAGE%%
```

For more information on how to extend this image with your own custom settings, adding more add-ons, building it or mounting volumes, please refer to our [documentation](https://docs.plone.org/manage/docker/docs/index.html)

## Supported Environment Variables

The Plone image uses several environment variable that allow to specify a more specific setup.

### For Basic Usage

-	`ADDONS` - Customize Plone via Plone add-ons using this environment variable
-	`SITE` - Add Plone instance with this id to `Data.fs` on first run. If NOT provided, you'll have to manually add a Plone Site via web UI
-	`ZEO_ADDRESS` - This environment variable allows you to run Plone image as a ZEO client.
-	`VERSIONS` - Use specific versions of Plone Add-on or python libraries

Run Plone and install two addons (eea.facetednavigation and collective.easyform)

```console
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -e SITE="mysite" -e ADDONS="eea.facetednavigation collective.easyform" %%IMAGE%%
```

To use specific add-ons versions:

```console
 -e ADDONS="eea.facetednavigation collective.easyform" \
 -e VERSIONS="eea.facetednavigation=13.3 collective.easyform=2.1.0"
```

RestAPI:

```console
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -e SITE=plone %%IMAGE%%

$ curl -H 'Accept: application/json' http://localhost:8080/plone
```
