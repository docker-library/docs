[Plone](https://plone.org) is a free and open source content management system built on top of the Zope application server.

%%LOGO%%

## Features

-	Images for Plone 5 and Plone 4
-	Enable add-ons via environment variables

## Usage

### Start a single Plone instance

This will download and start the latest Plone 5 container, based on [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).

```console
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 plone
```

This image includes `EXPOSE 8080` (the Plone port), so standard container linking will make it automatically available to the linked containers. Now you can add a Plone Site at http://localhost:8080 - default Zope user and password are `admin/admin`.

### Start Plone within a ZEO cluster

Start ZEO server

```console
$ docker run --name=zeo plone zeoserver
```

Start 2 Plone clients

```console
$ docker run --link=zeo -e ZEO_ADDRESS=zeo:8100 -p 8081:8080 plone
$ docker run --link=zeo -e ZEO_ADDRESS=zeo:8100 -p 8082:8080 plone
```

### Start Plone in debug mode

You can also start Plone in debug mode (`fg`) by running

```console
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 plone fg
```

### Add-ons

You can enable Plone add-ons via the `PLONE_ADDONS` environment variable

```console
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -e PLONE_ADDONS="eea.facetednavigation Products.PloneFormGen" plone
```

For more information on how to extend this image with your own custom settings, adding more add-ons, building it or mounting volumes, please refer to our [documentation](https://github.com/plone/plone.docker/blob/master/docs/usage.rst).

### Supported Environment Variables

The Plone image uses several environment variable that allow to specify a more specific setup.

-	`PLONE_ADDONS`, `ADDONS` - Customize Plone via Plone add-ons using this environment variable
-	`PLONE_ZCML`, `ZCML` - Include custom Plone add-ons ZCML files
-	`PLONE_DEVELOP`, `DEVELOP` - Develop new or existing Plone add-ons
-	`ZEO_ADDRESS` - This environment variable allows you to run Plone image as a ZEO client.
-	`ZEO_READ_ONLY` - Run Plone as a read-only ZEO client. Defaults to `off`.
-	`ZEO_CLIENT_READ_ONLY_FALLBACK` - A flag indicating whether a read-only remote storage should be acceptable as a fallback when no writable storages are available. Defaults to `false`.
-	`ZEO_SHARED_BLOB_DIR` - Set this to on if the ZEO server and the instance have access to the same directory. Defaults to `off`.
-	`ZEO_STORAGE` - Set the storage number of the ZEO storage. Defaults to `1`.
-	`ZEO_CLIENT_CACHE_SIZE` - Set the size of the ZEO client cache. Defaults to `128MB`.
-	`ZEO_PACK_KEEP_OLD` - Can be set to false to disable the creation of `*.fs.old` files before the pack is run. Defaults to true.
