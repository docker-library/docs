# What Is CrateDB?

[CrateDB](http://github.com/crate/crate) is a distributed SQL database that makes it simple to store and analyze massive amounts of machine data in real-time.

CrateDB offers the scalability and flexibility typically associated with a NoSQL database, is designed to run on inexpensive commodity servers and can be deployed and run on any sort of network - from personal computers to multi-region hybrid clouds.

The smallest CrateDB clusters can easily ingest tens of thousands of records per second. The data can be queried, ad-hoc, in parallel across the whole cluster in real time.

# Features

-	Standard SQL plus dynamic schemas, queryable objects, geospatial features, time series data, first-class BLOB support, and realtime full-text search.
-	Dynamic schemas, queryable objects, geospatial features, time series data support, and realtime full-text search providing functionality for handling both relational and document oriented nested data structures.
-	Horizontally scalable, highly available and fault tolerant clusters that run very well in virtualized and containerised environments.
-	Extremely fast distributed query execution.
-	Auto-partitioning, auto-sharding, and auto-replication.
-	Self-healing and auto-rebalancing.

# Screenshots

CrateDB provides an [Admin UI](https://crate.io/docs/crate/admin-ui/):

# Try CrateDB

Spin up this Docker image like so:

```console
$ docker run --publish 4200:4200 --publish 5432:5432 arm32v7/crate -Cdiscovery.type=single-node
```

Visit the [getting started](https://crate.io/docs/crate/tutorials/en/latest/install-run/) page to see all the available download and install options.

Once you're up and running, head over to the [introductory docs](https://crate.io/docs/crate/tutorials/). To interact with CrateDB, you can use the Admin UI [web console](https://crate.io/docs/crate/admin-ui/en/latest/console.html#sql-console) or the [CrateDB shell](https://crate.io/docs/crate/crash/) CLI tool. Alternatively, review the list of recommended [clients and tools](https://crate.io/docs/crate/clients-tools/) that work with CrateDB.

For container-specific documentation, check out the [CrateDB on Docker how-to guide](https://crate.io/docs/crate/howtos/en/latest/deployment/containers/docker.html) or the [CrateDB on Kubernetes how-to guide](https://crate.io/docs/crate/howtos/en/latest/deployment/containers/kubernetes.html).

## Issues

### Memory Accounting

The combinations of Linux kernel version 3.x and Docker >= 1.12 could lead to a major problem with memory accounting causing the kernel to kill the CrateDB process in the container. This problems occurs because of a [slab shrinker issue](https://lwn.net/Articles/628829/) that is fixed in kernel versions >= 4.0.
