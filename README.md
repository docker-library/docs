# What is this?

This repository contains the docs for each of the Docker official images. See [docker-library/official-images](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images) for the configuration how the images are built. To see all of the official images go to the [hub](https://hub.docker.com/explore/).

All Markdown files here are run through [tianon's fork of `markdownfmt`](https://github.com/tianon/markdownfmt) (only forked to add some smaller-diff preference and minor DockerHub-compatibility changes), and verified as formatted correctly via Travis-CI.

# How do I add a new image's docs

-	create a folder for my image: `mkdir myimage`
-	create a `README-short.txt` (required, 100 char max)
-	create a `content.md` (required)
-	create a `license.md` (required)
-	create a `github-repo` (required)
-	add a `logo.png` (recommended)

Optionally:

-	run `./markdownfmt.sh -l myimage` to verify whether format of your markdown files is compliant to `tianon/markdownfmt`. In case you see any file names, markdownfmt detected some issues, which might result in a failed build during continuous integration. run `./markdownfmt.sh -d myimage` to see a diff of changes required to pass.
-	run `./update.sh myimage` to generate `myimage/README.md` for manual review of the generated copy.  
	**Note:** do not actually commit the `README.md` file; it is automatically generated/committed before being uploaded to Docker Hub.

# How do I update an image's docs

To update `README.md` for a specific image do not edit `README.md` directly. Please edit `content.md` or another appropriate file within the folder. To see the changes, run `./update.sh myimage` from the repo root, but do not add the `README.md` changes to your pull request. See also `markdownfmt.sh` point [above](#how-do-i-add-a-new-images-docs).

# What are all these files?

## `update.sh`

This is the main script used to generate the `README.md` files for each image. The generated file is committed along with the files used to generate it (see below on what customizations are available). Accepted arguments are which image(s) you want to update or no arguments to update all of them.

This script assumes [`bashbrew`](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/tree/81e90ca8dcec892ade7eb348cba5a4a5d6851e17/bashbrew) is in your `PATH` (for scraping relevant tag information from the library manifest file for each repository).

## `generate-repo-stub-readme.sh`

This is used to generate a simple `README.md` to put in the image's repo. Argument is the name of the image, like `golang` and it then outputs the readme to standard out.

## `push.pl`

This is used by us to push the actual content of the READMEs to the Docker Hub as special access is required to modify the Hub description contents.

## `.template-helpers/generate-dockerfile-links-partial.sh`

This script is used by `update.sh` to create the "Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links" section of each generated `README.md` from the information in the [official-images `library/` manifests](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/tree/master/library).

## `.template-helpers/template.md` and `.template-helpers/user-feedback.md`

These files are the templates used in building the `<image name>/README.md` file, in combination with the individual image's files.

## folder `<image name>`

This is where all the partial and generated files for a given image reside, (ex: `golang/`).

## `<image name>/README.md`

This file is generated using `update.sh`.

## `<image name>/content.md`

This file contains the main content of your image's long description. The basic parts you should have are a "What Is" section and a "How To" section. See the doc on [Official Repos](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_repos/#a-long-description) for more information on long description. The issues and contribution section is generated by the script but can be overridden. The following is a basic layout:

```markdown
# What is XYZ?

// about what the contained software is

%%LOGO%%

# How to use this image

// descriptions and examples of common use cases for the image
// make use of subsections as necessary
```

## `<image name>/README-short.txt`

This is the short description for the docker hub, limited to 100 characters in a single line.

> Go (golang) is a general purpose, higher-level, imperative programming language.

## `<image name>/logo.png`

Logo for the contained software. While there are not hard rules on formatting, most existing logos are square or landscape and stay within a few hundred pixels of width.

## `<image name>/license.md`

This file should contain a link to the license for the main software in the image. Here is an example for `golang`:

```markdown
View [license information](http://golang.org/LICENSE) for the software contained in this image.
```

## `<image name>/github-repo`

This file should contain the URL to the GitHub repository for the Dockerfiles that become the images. The file should be in a single line ending in a newline with no extraneous whitespace. Only one GitHub repo per image repository is supported. It is used in generating links. Here is an example for `golang`:

```text
https://github.com/docker-library/golang
```

## `<image name>/user-feedback.md`

This file is an optional override of the default `user-feedback.md` for those repositories with different issue and contributing policies.
