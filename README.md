# What is this?

This repository contains the docs for each of the Docker official images.  See
[docker-library/official-images](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images)
for the configuration how the images are built.  To see all of the official
images go to the
[hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/stackbrew/?&s=alphabetical).

# How do I add a new image's docs

- create a folder for my image: `mkdir myimage`
- create a `README-short.txt` (required, 100 char max)
- create a `content.md` (required, 80 col wrap)
- create a `license.md` (required, 80 col wrap)
- add a `logo.png` (recommended)
- edit `update.sh` as needed (see below)
- run `./update.sh myimage` to generate `myimage/README.md`

# What are all these files?

## `update.sh`

This is the main script used to generate the `README.md` files for each image.
The generated file is committed along with the files used to generate it (see
below on what customizations are available).  When a new image is added that is
not under the `docker-library` namespace on GitHub, a new entry must be added to
the `otherRepos` array in this script.  Accepted arguments are which image(s)
you want to update and no arguments to update all of them.

## `push.pl`

This is used by us to push the actual content of the READMEs to the Docker Hub
as special access is required to modify the Hub description contents.

## `generate-dockerfile-links-partial.sh`

This script is used by `update.sh` to create the "Supported tags and respective
`Dockerfile` links" section of each generated `README.md` from the information
in the [official-images `library/`
manifests](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/tree/master/library).

## `generate-repo-stub-readme.sh`

This is used to generate a simple `README.md` to put in the image's repo.
Argument is the name of the image, like `golang` and it then outputs the readme
to standard out.

## `README-template.md` and `user-feedback.md`

These files are the templates used in building the `<image name>/README.md`
file, in combination with the individual image's files.

## folder `<image name>`

This is where all the partial and generated files for a given image reside, (ex:
`golang/`).

## `<image name>/README.md`

This file is generated using `update.sh`.

## `<image name>/content.md`

This file contains the main content of your readme.  The basic parts you should
have are a "What Is" section and a "How To" section.   See the doc on [Official
Repos](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_repos/#a-long-description)
for more information on long description.  The issues and contribution section
is generated by the script but can be overridden.  The following is a basic
layout:

    # What is XYZ?

    // about what the contained software is

    %%LOGO%%

    # How to use this image

    // descriptions and examples of common use cases for the image
    // make use of subsections as necessary

## `<image name>/README-short.txt`

This is the short description for the docker hub, limited to 100 characters in a
single line.

> Go (golang) is a general purpose, higher-level, imperative programming language.

## `<image name>/logo.png`

Logo for the contained software.  Specifications can be found in the docs on
[Official Repos](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_repos/#a-logo)

## `<image name>/license.md`

This file should contain a link to the license for the main software in the
image, wrapped to 80 columns.  Here is an example for golang:

    View [license information](http://golang.org/LICENSE)
    for the software contained in this image.

## `<image name>/user-feedback.md`

This file is an optional override of the default `user-feedback.md` for those
repositories with different issue and contributing policies.

## `<image name>/mailing-list.md`

This file is snippet that gets inserted into the user feedback section to
provide and extra way to get help, like a mailing list.  Here is an example from
the Postgres image:

    on the [mailing list](http://www.postgresql.org/community/lists/subscribe/) or
