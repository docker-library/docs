# What is this?

This repository contains the docs for each of the Docker official images. See [docker-library/official-images](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images) for the configuration how the images are built. To see all of the official images go to the [hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/stackbrew/?&s=alphabetical).

# How do I add a new image's docs

-	create a folder for my image: `mkdir myimage`
-	create a `README-short.txt` (required, 100 char max)
-	create a `content.md` (required, 80 col wrap)
-	create a `license.md` (required, 80 col wrap)
-	add a `logo.png` (recommended)
-	edit `update.sh` as needed (see below)
-	run `./update.sh myimage` to generate `myimage/README.md`

# What are all these files?

## `update.sh`

This is the main script used to generate the `README.md` files for each image. The generated file is committed along with the files used to generate it (see below on what customizations are available). When a new image is added that is not under the `docker-library` namespace on GitHub, a new entry must be added to the `otherRepos` array in this script. Accepted arguments are which image(s) you want to update and no arguments to update all of them.

## `push.pl`

This is used by us to push the actual content of the READMEs to the Docker Hub as special access is required to modify the Hub description contents.

## `generate-dockerfile-links-partial.sh`

This script is used by `update.sh` to create the "Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links" section of each generated `README.md` from the information in the [official-images `library/` manifests](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/tree/master/library).

## `generate-repo-stub-readme.sh`

This is used to generate a simple `README.md` to put in the image's repo. Argument is the name of the image, like `golang` and it then outputs the readme to standard out.

## `README-template.md` and `user-feedback.md`

These files are the templates used in building the `<image name>/README.md` file, in combination with the individual image's files.

## folder `<image name>`

This is where all the partial and generated files for a given image reside, (ex: `golang/`).

## `<image name>/README.md`

This file is generated using `update.sh`.

## `<image name>/content.md`

This file contains the main content of your readme. The basic parts you should have are a "What Is" section and a "How To" section. See the doc on [Official Repos](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_repos/#a-long-description) for more information on long description. The issues and contribution section is generated by the script but can be overridden. The following is a basic layout:

	# What is XYZ?
	
	// about what the contained software is
	
	%%LOGO%%
	
	# How to use this image
	
	// descriptions and examples of common use cases for the image
	// make use of subsections as necessary

## `<image name>/README-short.txt`

This is the short description for the docker hub, limited to 100 characters in a single line.

> Go (golang) is a general purpose, higher-level, imperative programming language.

## `<image name>/logo.png`

Logo for the contained software. Specifications can be found in the docs on [Official Repos](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_repos/#a-logo)

## `<image name>/license.md`

This file should contain a link to the license for the main software in the image, wrapped to 80 columns. Here is an example for `golang`:

	View [license information](http://golang.org/LICENSE)
	for the software contained in this image.

## `<image name>/user-feedback.md`

This file is an optional override of the default `user-feedback.md` for those repositories with different issue and contributing policies.

## `<image name>/mailing-list.md`

This file is snippet that gets inserted into the user feedback section to provide and extra way to get help, like a mailing list. Here is an example from the Postgres image:

	on the [mailing list](http://www.postgresql.org/community/lists/subscribe/) or
