## `%%IMAGE%%:slim`

This image does not contain the common packages contained in the default tag and only contains the minimal packages needed to run `%%IMAGE%%`. Unless you are working in an environment where *only* the `%%IMAGE%%` image will be deployed and you have space constraints, we highly recommend using the default image of this repository.
