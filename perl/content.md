# What is Perl?

Perl is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. The Perl language borrows features from other programming languages, including C, shell scripting (sh), AWK, and sed.

# How to use this image

## Create a `Dockerfile` in your Perl app project

```dockerfile
FROM perl:5.20
COPY . /usr/src/myapp
WORKDIR /usr/src/myapp
CMD [ "perl", "./your-daemon-or-script.pl" ]
```

Then, build and run the Docker image:

```console
$ docker build -t my-perl-app .
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-perl-app
```

## Run a single Perl script

For many simple, single file projects, you may find it inconvenient to write a complete `Dockerfile`. In such cases, you can run a Perl script by using the Perl Docker image directly:

```console
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-script -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp perl:5.20 perl your-daemon-or-script.pl
```
