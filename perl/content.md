# What is Perl?

Perl is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming
language. The Perl language borrows features from other programming languages,
including C, shell scripting (sh), AWK, and sed.

# How to use this image

## Create a `Dockerfile` in your Perl app project

    FROM perl:5.20
    COPY . /usr/src/myapp
    WORKDIR /usr/src/myapp
    CMD [ "perl", "./your-daemon-or-script.pl" ]

Then, build and run the Docker image:

    docker build -t my-perl-app .
    docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-perl-app

## Run a single Perl script

For many simple, single file projects, you may find it inconvenient to write a
complete `Dockerfile`. In such cases, you can run a Perl script by using the
Perl Docker image directly:

    docker run -it --rm --name my-running-script -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp perl:5.20 perl your-daemon-or-script.pl
