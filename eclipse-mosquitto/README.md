# How to use this image

## Directories

Three directories have been created in the image to be used for configuration, persistent storage and logs.

	/mosquitto/config
	/mosquitto/data
	/mosquitto/log

## Configuration

When running the image, the default configuration values are used. To use a custom configuration file, mount a **local** configuration file to `/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf`

	docker run -it -p 1883:1883 -p 9001:9001 -v mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf eclipse-mosquitto

Configuration can be changed to:

-	persist data to `/mosquitto/data`
-	log to `/mosquitto/log/mosquitto.log`

i.e. add the following to `mosquitto.conf`:

	persistence true
	persistence_location /mosquitto/data/
	log_dest file /mosquitto/log/mosquitto.log

**Note**: If a volume is used, the data will persist between containers.

## Run

Run a container using the new image:

	docker run -it -p 1883:1883 -p 9001:9001 -v mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf -v /mosquitto/data -v /mosquitto/log eclipse-mosquitto

**Note**: if the mosquitto configuration (mosquitto.conf) was modified to use non-default ports, the docker run command will need to be updated to expose the ports that have been configured.
