# What is Eclipse Mosquitto?

Eclipse Mosquitto is an open source implementation of a server for versions 5, 3.1.1, and 3.1 of the MQTT protocol. Main homepages: http://mosquitto.org/

![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker-library/docs/757578e3a44e5460a8a11d32a81776f8b74231a9/eclipse-mosquitto/logo.png)

# How to use this image

## Directories

Three directories have been created in the image to be used for configuration, persistent storage and logs.

	/mosquitto/config
	/mosquitto/data
	/mosquitto/log

## Configuration

When running the image, the default configuration values are used. To use a custom configuration file, mount a **local** configuration file to `/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf`

```console
$ docker run -it -p 1883:1883 -p 9001:9001 -v mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf winamd64/eclipse-mosquitto
```

Configuration can be changed to:

-	persist data to `/mosquitto/data`
-	log to `/mosquitto/log/mosquitto.log`

i.e. add the following to `mosquitto.conf`:

	persistence true
	persistence_location /mosquitto/data/
	log_dest file /mosquitto/log/mosquitto.log

**Note**: If a volume is used, the data will persist between containers.

## Run

Run a container using the new image:

```console
$ docker run -it -p 1883:1883 -p 9001:9001 -v mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf -v /mosquitto/data -v /mosquitto/log winamd64/eclipse-mosquitto
```

**Note**: if the mosquitto configuration (mosquitto.conf) was modified to use non-default ports, the docker run command will need to be updated to expose the ports that have been configured.
