# What is Ruby?

Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose, open-source
programming language. According to its authors, Ruby was influenced by Perl,
Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
including functional, object-oriented, and imperative. It also has a dynamic
type system and automatic memory management.

# How to use this image

## Create a `Dockerfile` in your Ruby app project

    FROM ruby:2.1-onbuild
    CMD ["./your-daemon-or-script.rb"]

Put this file in the root of your app, next to the `Gemfile`.

This image includes multiple `ONBUILD` triggers which should be all you need to
bootstrap most applications.  The build will `COPY . /usr/src/app` and `RUN
bundle install`.

You can then build and run the Ruby image:

    docker build -t my-ruby-app .
    docker run -it --name my-running-script my-ruby-app

### Generate a `Gemfile.lock`

The `onbuid` tag expects a `Gemfile.lock` in your app directory. This `docker
run` will help you generate one. Run it in the root of your app, next to the
`Gemfile`:

    docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/usr/src/app -w /usr/src/app ruby:2.1 bundle install

## Run a single Ruby script

For many simple, single file projects, you may find it inconvenient to write a
complete `Dockerfile`. In such cases, you can run a Ruby script by using the
Ruby Docker image directly:

    docker run -it --rm --name my-running-script -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp ruby:2.1 ruby your-daemon-or-script.rb
