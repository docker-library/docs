# Clear Linux OS

This serves as the official [Clear Linux OS](https://clearlinux.org) image.

%%LOGO%%

The `clearlinux:latest` tag will point to `clearlinux:base` which will track toward the latest release version of the distribution.

This image contains the os-core and os-core-update bundles, the latter can be used to add additional Clear Linux OS components (see [here](https://clearlinux.org/documentation/swupdate_about_sw_update.html) for more details about swupd and [here](https://clearlinux.org/documentation/bundles_overview.html) for more information on bundles).

The following Dockerfile will install the editors and dev-utils bundles on top of the base image

```sh
FROM clearlinux:base
RUN swupd bundle-add editors dev-utils
```

Where editors contains the usual suspects for command line editors and dev-utils contains some handy development tools like strace, gdb and valgrind.
