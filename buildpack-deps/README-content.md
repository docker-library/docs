# What is buildpack-deps?

In spirit, `buildpack-deps` is similar to [Heroku's stack images](https://github.com/heroku/stack-images/blob/master/bin/cedar.sh). It includes a
large number of "development header" packages needed by various things like Ruby Gems,
PyPI modules, etc. For example, `buildpack-deps` would let you do a `bundle install` in
an arbitrary application directory without knowing beforehand that `ssl.h` is required to
build a dependent module.
