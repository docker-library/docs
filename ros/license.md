The core of ROS 2 is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. This is a very permissive open license that allows for modification, distribution, commercial use, patent use, and private use in open and closed source products. You can find more about the license from the [Apache License](https://www.apache.org/licenses) website or Opensource.org [Apache License 2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) page.

While the core parts of ROS 2 are licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, other licenses are commonly used in the community packages, such as the [BSD 3-Clause](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) license, the [GPL](https://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license) license, the [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license, and even proprietary licenses. Each package in the ROS ecosystem is required to specify a license, so that it is easy for you to quickly identify if a package will meet your licensing needs.
