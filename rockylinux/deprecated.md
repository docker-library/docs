# IMPORTANT NOTE

The Docker team curates the Official Images program, and there are currently some technical constraints preventing Rocky Linux from publishing updates here. For the most up-to-date container images, please refer to the [Rocky Linux Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/rockylinux/rockylinux) for now.
