# How to use this image

```console
$ docker run --name some-piwik --link some-mysql:db -d piwik
```

Now you can get access to fpm running on port 9000 inside the container. If you want to access it from the Internets, we recommend using a reverse proxy in front. You can find more information on that on the [docker-compose](#docker-compose) section.

## Via docker-compose

You can use a setup that is used in production at [IndieHosters/piwik](https://github.com/indiehosters/piwik).

## Installation

Once started, you'll arrive at the configuration wizard. At the `Database Setup` step, please enter the following:

-	Database Server: `db`
-	Login: `root`
-	Password: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
-	Database Name: piwik (or you can choose)

And leave the rest as default.

Then you can continue the installation with the super user.
