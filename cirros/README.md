# What is CirrOS?

The CirrOS project provides linux disk and kernel/initramfs images. The images are well suited for testing as they are small and boot quickly. Please note that:

-	**Images are provided for test only**. They should not be used in production.
-	**Images have well known login information**. Users can log in with 'cirros:letsgocubs' locally or remotely and have passwordless sudo access to root.

CirrOS images have useful tools and function for debugging or developing cloud infrastructure.
