# What is Hipache?

**Hipache** (pronounced `hɪ'pætʃɪ`) is a distributed proxy designed to route
high volumes of http and websocket traffic to unusually large numbers of virtual
hosts, in a highly dynamic topology where backends are added and removed several
times per second. It is particularly well-suited for PaaS
(platform-as-a-service) and other environments that are both business-critical
and multi-tenant.

Hipache was originally developed at [dotCloud](http://www.dotcloud.com), a
popular platform-as-a-service, to replace its first-generation routing layer
based on a heavily instrumented nginx deployment. It currently serves production
traffic for tens of thousands of applications hosted on dotCloud. Hipache is
based on the node-http-proxy library.
