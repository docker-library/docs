# What is PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL, often simply "Postgres", is an object-relational database management
system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and standards-compliance. As a
database server, its primary function is to store data, securely and supporting
best practices, and retrieve it later, as requested by other software
applications, be it those on the same computer or those running on another
computer across a network (including the Internet). It can handle workloads
ranging from small single-machine applications to large Internet-facing
applications with many concurrent users. Recent versions also provide
replication of the database itself for security and scalability.

PostgreSQL implements the majority of the SQL:2011 standard, is ACID-compliant
and transactional (including most DDL statements) avoiding locking issues using
multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), provides immunity to dirty reads and
full serializability; handles complex SQL queries using many indexing methods
that are not available in other databases; has updateable views and materialized
views, triggers, foreign keys; supports functions and stored procedures, and
other expandability, and has a large number of extensions written by third
parties. In addition to the possibility of working with the major proprietary
and open source databases, PostgreSQL supports migration from them, by its
extensive standard SQL support and available migration tools. And if proprietary
extensions had been used, by its extensibility that can emulate many through
some built-in and third-party open source compatibility extensions, such as for
Oracle.

# How to use this image

## start a postgres instance

    docker run --name some-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres

This image includes `EXPOSE 5432` (the postgres port), so standard container
linking will make it automatically available to the linked containers. The
default `postgres` user and database are created in the entrypoint with
`initdb`.
> The postgres database is a default database meant for use by users, utilities
> and third party applications.
> [postgresql.org/docs](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/interactive/app-initdb.html)

## connect to it from an application

    docker run --name some-app --link some-postgres:postgres -d application-that-uses-postgres

## ... or via `psql`

    docker run -it --link some-postgres:postgres --rm postgres sh -c 'exec psql -h "$POSTGRES_PORT_5432_TCP_ADDR" -p "$POSTGRES_PORT_5432_TCP_PORT" -U postgres'

## Environment Variables

The PostgreSQL image uses several environment variables which are easy to miss.
While none of the variables are required, they may significantly aid you in
using the image.

### `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`

This environment variable is recommend for you to use the PostgreSQL image. This
environment variable sets the superuser password for PostgreSQL. The default
superuser is defined by the `POSTGRES_USER` environment variable. In the above
example, it is being set to "mysecretpassword".

### `POSTGRES_USER`

This optional environment variable is used in conjunction with
`POSTGRES_PASSWORD` to set a user and its password. This varible will create the
specified user with superuser power and a database with the same name. If it is
not specified, then the default user of `postgres` will be used.

# How to extend this image

If you would like to do additional initialization in an image derived from this
one, add a `*.sh` script under `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` (creating the
directory if necessary). After the entrypoint calls `initdb` to create the
default `postgres` user and database, it will source any `*.sh` script found in
that directory to do further initialization before starting the service. If you
need to execute SQL commands as part of your initialization, the use of
Postgres'' [single user
mode](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/app-postgres.html#AEN90580) is
highly recommended.

## Example use of this image

Dockerfile
```
FROM postgres:8.4.22
MAINTAINER Leonard Seymore <leonardseymore@gmail.com>

ENV POSTGRES_USERNAME postgres
ENV POSTGRES_PASSWORD postgres
ENV USERNAME mydb_username
ENV PASSWORD mydb_password
ENV DATABASE mydb_name
ENV SCHEMA mydb_schema_name
ENV PGPASSWORD $PASSWORD

ADD scripts /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
```

Example initialization script (init.sh) in scripts directory
```
#!/bin/bash

echo "Running custom init script"

gosu postgres postgres --single <<- EOSQL
    create user $USERNAME with password '$PASSWORD' nocreateuser nocreatedb;
    create database $DATABASE with owner=$USERNAME;
    create schema $SCHEMA AUTHORIZATION $USERNAME;
EOSQL

echo "Custom init script complete."
```

# Caveats

If there is no database when `postgres` starts in a container, then `postgres` will
create the default database for you. While this is the expected behavior of
`postgres`, this means that it will not accept incoming connections during that
time. This may cause issues when using automation tools, such as `fig`, that
start several containers simultaneously.
