## Contributing

You are invited to contribute new features, fixes, or updates, large or small;
we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them
as fast as we can.

Before you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans on the
[mailing list](http://www.postgresql.org/community/lists/subscribe/) or
through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/docker-library/postgres/issues), especially for more ambitious
contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right
direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone
else is working on the same thing.
