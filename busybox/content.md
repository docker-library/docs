# What is BusyBox? The Swiss Army Knife of Embedded Linux

Coming in somewhere between 1 and 5 Mb in on-disk size (depending on the variant), [BusyBox](http://www.busybox.net/) is a very good ingredient to craft space-efficient distributions.

BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable. It provides replacements for most of the utilities you usually find in GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc. The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU counterparts. BusyBox provides a fairly complete environment for any small or embedded system.

# How to use this image

## Run BusyBox shell

```console
$ docker run -it --rm %%IMAGE%%
```

This will drop you into an `sh` shell to allow you to do what you want inside a BusyBox system.

## Create a `Dockerfile` for a binary

```dockerfile
FROM %%IMAGE%%
COPY ./my-static-binary /my-static-binary
CMD ["/my-static-binary"]
```

This `Dockerfile` will allow you to create a minimal image for your statically compiled binary. You will have to compile the binary in some other place like another container. For a simpler alternative that's similarly tiny but easier to extend, [see `alpine`](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/).
