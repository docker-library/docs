# Image Variants

The `%%IMAGE%%` images contain BusyBox built against various "libc" variants (for a comparison of "libc" variants, [Eta Labs has a very nice chart](http://www.etalabs.net/compare_libcs.html) which lists many similarities and differences).

For more information about the specific particulars of the build process for each variant, see `Dockerfile.builder` in the same directory as each variant's `Dockerfile` (see links above).
