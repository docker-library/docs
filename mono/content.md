# What is Mono

Sponsored by Xamarin, Mono is an open source implementation of Microsoft's .NET Framework based on the ECMA standards for C# and the Common Language Runtime. A growing family of solutions and an active and enthusiastic contributing community is helping position Mono to become the leading choice for development of cross platform applications.

# How to use this image

This image will run stand-alone Mono console apps.

## Create a `Dockerfile` in your Mono app project

This example Dockerfile will run an executable called `TestingConsoleApp.exe`.

```dockerfile
FROM %%IMAGE%%:3.10-onbuild
CMD [ "mono",  "./TestingConsoleApp.exe" ]
```

Place this file in the root of your app, next to the `.sln` solution file. Modify the exectuable name to match what you want to run.

This image includes `ONBUILD` triggers that adds your app source code to `/usr/src/app/source`, restores NuGet packages and compiles the app, placing the output in `/usr/src/app/build`.

With the Dockerfile in place, you can build and run a Docker image with your app:

```console
$ docker build -t my-app .
$ docker run my-app
```

You should see any output from your app now.
