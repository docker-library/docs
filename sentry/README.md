# What is Sentry?

Sentry is a realtime event logging and aggregation platform. It specializes in monitoring errors and extracting all the information needed to do a proper post-mortem without any of the hassle of the standard user feedback loop.

# How to use this image

## How to setup a full Sentry instance

1.	Start a Redis container

	```console
	$ docker run -d --name sentry-redis redis
	```

2.	Start a Postgres container

	```console
	$ docker run -d --name sentry-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret -e POSTGRES_USER=sentry postgres
	```

3.	Generate a new secret key to be shared by all `sentry` containers. This value will then be used as the `SENTRY_SECRET_KEY` environment variable.

	```console
	$ docker run --rm sentry generate-secret-key
	```

4.	If this is a new database, you'll need to run `upgrade`

	```console
	$ docker run -it --rm -e SENTRY_SECRET_KEY='<secret-key>' --link sentry-postgres:postgres --link sentry-redis:redis sentry upgrade
	```

	**Note: the `-it` is important as the initial upgrade will prompt to create an initial user and will fail without it**

5.	Now start up Sentry server

	```console
	$ docker run -d --name my-sentry -e SENTRY_SECRET_KEY='<secret-key>' --link sentry-redis:redis --link sentry-postgres:postgres sentry
	```

6.	The default config needs a celery beat and celery workers, start as many workers as you need (each with a unique name)

	```console
	$ docker run -d --name sentry-cron -e SENTRY_SECRET_KEY='<secret-key>' --link sentry-postgres:postgres --link sentry-redis:redis sentry run cron
	$ docker run -d --name sentry-worker-1 -e SENTRY_SECRET_KEY='<secret-key>' --link sentry-postgres:postgres --link sentry-redis:redis sentry run worker
	```

### Port mapping

If you'd like to be able to access the instance from the host without the container's IP, standard port mappings can be used. Just add `-p 8080:9000` to the `docker run` arguments and then access either `http://localhost:8080` or `http://host-ip:8080` in a browser.

## Configuring the initial user

If you did not create a superuser during `upgrade`, use the following to create one:

```console
$ docker run -it --rm -e SENTRY_SECRET_KEY='<secret-key>' --link sentry-redis:redis --link sentry-postgres:postgres sentry createuser
```

## Environment variables

When you start the `sentry` image, you can adjust the configuration of the Sentry instance by passing one or more environment variables on the `docker run` command line. Please note that these environment variables are provided as a jump start, and it's highly recommended to either mount in your own config file or utilize the `sentry:onbuild` variant.

### `SENTRY_SECRET_KEY`

A secret key used for cryptographic functions within Sentry. This key should be unique and consistent across all running instances. You can generate a new secret key doing something like:

```console
$ docker run --rm sentry generate-secret-key
```

### `SENTRY_POSTGRES_HOST`, `SENTRY_POSTGRES_PORT`, `SENTRY_DB_NAME`, `SENTRY_DB_USER`, `SENTRY_DB_PASSWORD`

Database credentials for your Postgres server. These values aren't needed if a linked `postgres` container exists.

### `SENTRY_REDIS_HOST`, `SENTRY_REDIS_PORT`, `SENTRY_REDIS_DB`

Connection information for your Redis server. These values aren't needed if a linked `redis` container exists.

### `SENTRY_MEMCACHED_HOST`, `SENTRY_MEMCACHED_PORT`

Connection information for a Memcache server. These values aren't needed if a linked `memcached` container exists.

### `SENTRY_FILESTORE_DIR`

Directory where uploaded files will be stored. This defaults to `/var/lib/sentry/files` and is a `VOLUME` for persistent data.

### `SENTRY_SERVER_EMAIL`

The email address used for `From:` in outbound emails. Default: `root@localhost`

### `SENTRY_EMAIL_HOST`, `SENTRY_EMAIL_PORT`, `SENTRY_EMAIL_USER`, `SENTRY_EMAIL_PASSWORD`, `SENTRY_EMAIL_USE_TLS`

Connection information for an outbound smtp server. These values aren't needed if a linked `smtp` container exists.

### `SENTRY_MAILGUN_API_KEY`

If you're using Mailgun for inbound mail, set your API key and configure a route to forward to `/api/hooks/mailgun/inbound/`.

# Image Variants

The `sentry` images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific use case.

## `sentry:<version>`

This is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both as a throw away container (mount your source code and start the container to start your app), as well as the base to build other images off of.

## `sentry:onbuild`

This image makes it easy to custom build your own Sentry instance by copying in a custom `config.yml` and/or `sentry.conf.py` file and installing plugins from `requirements.txt`.

It's also possible to develop custom extensions within your `onbuild` package. If the build directory contains a `setup.py` file, this will also get installed.

See the [official Sentry documentation](https://docs.getsentry.com/on-premise/server/installation/) for more information.
