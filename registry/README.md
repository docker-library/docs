# Docker Registry

See comprehensive documentation on our [GitHub
page](https://github.com/docker/docker-registry).

## Run the Registry

### Recommended: run the registry docker container

 * install docker according to the [following
   instructions](http://docs.docker.io/installation/#installation)
 * run the registry: `docker run -p 5000:5000 registry`

or

```
docker run \
         -e SETTINGS_FLAVOR=s3 \
         -e AWS_BUCKET=acme-docker \
         -e STORAGE_PATH=/registry \
         -e AWS_KEY=AKIAHSHB43HS3J92MXZ \
         -e AWS_SECRET=xdDowwlK7TJajV1Y7EoOZrmuPEJlHYcNP2k4j49T \
         -e SEARCH_BACKEND=sqlalchemy \
         -p 5000:5000 \
         registry
```

NOTE: The container will try to allocate the port 5000. If the port is already
taken, find out which container is already using it by running `docker ps`.
