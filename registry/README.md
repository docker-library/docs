# Docker Registry

This image contains an implementation of the Docker Registry HTTP API V2 for use with Docker 1.6+. See [github.com/docker/distribution](https://github.com/docker/distribution) for more details about what it is.

## Run a local registry: Quick Version

$ docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart always --name registry registry:2
```

Now, use it from within Docker:

```console
$ docker pull ubuntu
$ docker tag ubuntu localhost:5000/ubuntu
$ docker push localhost:5000/ubuntu
```
