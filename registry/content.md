# Docker Registry

This image contains an implementation of the Docker Registry HTTP API V2 for use with Docker 1.6+. See [github.com/docker/distribution](https://github.com/docker/distribution) for more details about what it is.

## Run a local registry: Quick Version

```console
$ docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart always --name registry %%IMAGE%%:2
```

Now, use it from within Docker:

```console
$ docker pull ubuntu
$ docker tag ubuntu localhost:5000/ubuntu
$ docker push localhost:5000/ubuntu
```

## Recommended Reading

The [documentation over at docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/registry/) is a good place to learn more about what the registry is, how it works, and how to use it.

Specifically, [the section regarding deployment](https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/) has pointers for more complex use cases than simply running a registry on localhost.

# Support

If you are interested in commercial support, the [Docker Trusted Registry](https://www.docker.com/docker-trusted-registry) provides an image registry, LDAP/Active Directory integration, security certificates, and more in a solution that includes commercial support.
