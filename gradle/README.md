# What is Gradle?

[Gradle](https://gradle.org/) is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language development. If you are building, testing, publishing, and deploying software on any platform, Gradle offers a flexible model that can support the entire development lifecycle from compiling and packaging code to publishing web sites. Gradle has been designed to support build automation across multiple languages and platforms including Java, Scala, Android, C/C++, and Groovy, and is closely integrated with development tools and continuous integration servers including Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Jenkins.

# How to use this image

## Building a Gradle project

Run this from the directory of the Gradle project you want to build.

`docker run --rm -u gradle -v "$PWD":/home/gradle/project -w /home/gradle/project arm32v7/gradle gradle <gradle-task>`

Note the above command runs using uid/gid 1000 (user *gradle*) to avoid running as root.

If you are mounting a volume and the uid/gid running Docker is not *1000*, you should run as user *root* (`-u root`). *root* is also the default, so you can also simply not specify a user.
