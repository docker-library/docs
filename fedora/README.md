# Fedora

This image serves as the `official Fedora image` for `Fedora 21` and as a
semi-official image for Fedora 20 (heisenbug) and rawhide.

![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker-library/docs/master/fedora/logo.png)

The `fedora:latest` tag will always point to the latest stable
release, currently [Fedora 21](https://getfedora.org/). `fedora:latest` is
now the same as `fedora:21`.

Fedora rawhide is available via `fedora:rawhide` and Fedora 20 via
`fedora:20` and `fedora:heisenbug`.

The metalink `http://mirrors.fedoraproject.org` is used to automatically select
a mirror site (both for building the image as well as for the yum repos in the
container image).

    $ docker run fedora cat /etc/yum.repos.d/fedora.repo | grep metalink
    metalink=https://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/metalink?repo=fedora-$releasever&arch=$basearch
    metalink=https://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/metalink?repo=fedora-debug-$releasever&arch=$basearch
    metalink=https://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/metalink?repo=fedora-source-$releasever&arch=$basearch
