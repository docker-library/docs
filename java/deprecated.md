This image is officially deprecated in favor of [the `openjdk` image](https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk/), and will receive no further updates after 2016-12-31 (Dec 31, 2016). Please adjust your usage accordingly.

The image has been OpenJDK-specific since it was first introduced, and as of 2016-08-10 we also have [an `ibmjava` image](https://hub.docker.com/_/ibmjava/), which made it even more clear that each repository should represent one upstream instead of one language stack or community, so this rename reflects that clarity appropriately.
