# What is Python?

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, open-source programming
language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level
dynamic data types, and classes. Python combines remarkable power with very
clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as
to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as
an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface.
Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants, on the Mac, and on
Windows 2000 and later.

# How to use this image

## Create a `Dockerfile` in your Python app project

    FROM python:3-onbuild
    CMD [ "python", "./your-daemon-or-script.py" ]

or (if you need to use Python 2):

    FROM python:2-onbuild
    CMD [ "python", "./your-daemon-or-script.py" ]

These images include multiple `ONBUILD` triggers, which should be all you need
to bootstrap most applications. The build will `COPY` a `requirements.txt` file,
`RUN pip install` on said file, and then copy the current directory into
`/usr/src/app`.

You can then build and run the Docker image:

    docker build -t my-python-app .
    docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-python-app

## Run a single Python script

For many simple, single file projects, you may find it inconvenient to write a
complete `Dockerfile`. In such cases, you can run a Python script by using the
Python Docker image directly:

    docker run -it --rm --name my-running-script -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp python:3 python your-daemon-or-script.py

or (again, if you need to use Python 2):

    docker run -it --rm --name my-running-script -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp python:2 python your-daemon-or-script.py
