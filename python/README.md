# What is Python?

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, open-source programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants, on the Mac, and on Windows 2000 and later.

# How to use this image

## Create a `Dockerfile` in your Python app project

```dockerfile
FROM mips64le/python:3

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD [ "python", "./your-daemon-or-script.py" ]
```

or (if you need to use Python 2):

```dockerfile
FROM mips64le/python:2

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD [ "python", "./your-daemon-or-script.py" ]
```

You can then build and run the Docker image:

```console
$ docker build -t my-python-app .
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-python-app
```

## Run a single Python script

For many simple, single file projects, you may find it inconvenient to write a complete `Dockerfile`. In such cases, you can run a Python script by using the Python Docker image directly:

```console
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-script -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp mips64le/python:3 python your-daemon-or-script.py
```

or (again, if you need to use Python 2):

```console
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-script -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp mips64le/python:2 python your-daemon-or-script.py
```

## Multiple Python versions in the image

In the non-slim variants there will be an additional (distro-provided) `python` executable at `/usr/bin/python` (and/or `/usr/bin/python3`) while the desired image-provided `/usr/local/bin/python` is the default choice in the `$PATH`. This is an unfortunate side-effect of using the `buildpack-deps` image in the non-slim variants (and many distribution-provided tools being written against and likely to break with a different Python installation, so we can't safely remove/overwrite it).

As with all Docker images, these likely also contain other software which may be under other licenses (such as Bash, etc from the base distribution, along with any direct or indirect dependencies of the primary software being contained).

Some additional license information which was able to be auto-detected might be found in [the `repo-info` repository's `python/` directory](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info/tree/master/repos/python).
