# What is KrakenD?

[KrakenD](https://www.krakend.io/) is a stateless, high-performance, enterprise-ready, open-source API gateway written in Go. Its engine (formerly known as *KrakenD Framework*) is now a **Linux Foundation Project** codenamed [Lura Project](https://luraproject.org/). Lura is the only enterprise-grade API Gateway hosted in a neutral, open forum.

KrakenD is lightweight and straightforward, as it only requires writing the configuration file. No Go knowledge is required. It offers connectivity to internal and external services, data transformation and filtering, and aggregation of multiple data sources (APIs, gRPC, queues and pub/sub, lambda, etc.) simultaneously or in cascade. It protects access to your API, throughputs its usage, and integrates with many third-parties.

All features are designed to offer extraordinary performance and infinite scalability.

## How to use this image

KrakenD only needs a single configuration file to create an API Gateway, although you can have a complex setup reflecting your organization structure. The configuration file(s) can live anywhere in the container, but the default location (the workdir) is `/etc/krakend`.

To use the image, `COPY` your `krakend.json` file inside the container or mount it using a volume. The configuration is checked only once during the startup and never used again. Don't have a config file yet? Generate it with the [KrakenD Designer UI](https://designer.krakend.io).

⚠️ **NOTICE**: KrakenD does not use live reload when your configuration changes. Restart the container.

### Quick start

You can start an empty gateway with a health check with the following commands:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -v "$PWD:/etc/krakend/" amd64/krakend

curl http://localhost:8080/__health
{"agents":{},"now":"2024-05-23 14:35:55.552591448 +0000 UTC m=+26.856583003","status":"ok"}
```

### More Examples

The following are several examples of running KrakenD. By default, the command `run` is executed, but you can pass other commands and flags at the end of the run command.

The configuration files are taken from the current directory (`$PWD`). Therefore, all examples expect to find at least the file `krakend.json`.

#### Run with the debug enabled (flag `-d`):

This flag is **SAFE to use in production**. It's meant to enable KrakenD as a fake backend itself by enabling a [`/__debug` endpoint](https://www.krakend.io/docs/endpoints/debug-endpoint/)

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v "${PWD}:/etc/krakend/" amd64/krakend run -d -c /etc/krakend/krakend.json
```

#### Checking the syntax of your configuration file

See the [check command](https://www.krakend.io/docs/commands/check/)

```bash
docker run -it -v $PWD:/etc/krakend/ amd64/krakend check --config krakend.json
```

#### Show the help:

```bash
docker run --rm -it amd64/krakend help
```

### Building your custom KrakenD image

Most production deployments will not want to rely on mounting a volume for the container but to use their image based on `amd64/krakend`:

Your `Dockerfile` could look like this:

```Dockerfile
FROM amd64/krakend:<version>
# NOTE: Avoid using :latest image on production. Stick to a major version instead.

COPY krakend.json ./

# Check and test that the file is valid
RUN krakend check -t --lint-no-network -c krakend.json
```

If you want to manage your KrakenD configuration using multiple files and folders, reusing templates, and distributing the configuration amongst your teams, you can use the [flexible configuration (FC)](https://www.krakend.io/docs/configuration/flexible-config/). The following `Dockerfile` combines FC, the `krakend check` command, and a 2-step build.

```Dockerfile
FROM amd64/krakend:<version> as builder

COPY krakend.tmpl .
COPY config .

# Save temporary output file to /tmp to avoid permission errors
RUN FC_ENABLE=1 \
    FC_OUT=/tmp/krakend.json \
    FC_PARTIALS="/etc/krakend/partials" \
    FC_SETTINGS="/etc/krakend/settings" \
    FC_TEMPLATES="/etc/krakend/templates" \
    krakend check -d -t -c krakend.tmpl

# Copy the output file only and discard any other files
FROM amd64/krakend:<version>
COPY --from=builder /tmp/krakend.json .
```

Then build with `docker build -t my_krakend .`

The configuration above assumes you have a folder structure like the following:

	.
	├── config
	│   ├── partials
	│   ├── settings
	│   │   └── env.json
	│   └── templates
	│       └── some.tmpl
	├── Dockerfile
	└── krakend.tmpl

### Docker Compose example

Finally, a simple `docker compose` file to start KrakenD with your API would be:

```yaml
services:
  krakend:
    image: amd64/krakend:<version>
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./:/etc/krakend
```

And another one that uses the flexible configuration and a custom template filename (`my_krakend.tmpl`) on each start:

```yaml
services:
  krakend:
    image: amd64/krakend:<version>
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./:/etc/krakend
    environment:
      - FC_ENABLE=1
      - FC_OUT=/tmp/krakend.json
      - FC_PARTIALS="/etc/krakend/config/partials"
      - FC_SETTINGS="/etc/krakend/config/settings/prod"
      - FC_TEMPLATES="/etc/krakend/config/templates"
    command:
      command: ["krakend", "run", "-c", "krakend.tmpl", "-d"]
```

### Container permissions and commands

All `krakend` commands are executed as `krakend` user (uid=1000), and the rest of the commands (e.g., `sh`) are executed as root.

You can directly use sub-commands of `krakend` like `run`, `help`, `version`, `check`, `check-plugin`, or `test-plugin` as the entrypoint will add the `krakend` command automatically. For example, the following lines are equivalent:

```bash
docker run --rm -it amd64/krakend help
docker run --rm -it amd64/krakend krakend help
```
