# **DEPRECATION NOTICE**

This image has been deprecated in favor of the [official `kibana` image](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/_pulling_the_image.html) provided and maintained by [elastic.co](https://www.elastic.co/). The list of images available from Elastic can be found at [www.docker.elastic.co](https://www.docker.elastic.co/). The images found here will receive no further updates once the `6.0.0` release is available upstream. Please adjust your usage accordingly.

Elastic provides open-source support for Kibana via the [elastic/kibana GitHub repository](https://github.com/elastic/kibana) and the Docker image via the [elastic/kibana-docker GitHub repository](https://github.com/elastic/kibana-docker), as well as community support via its [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/kibana).

# Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

**No supported tags found!**

It is very likely that `kibana` does not support the currently selected architecture (`s390x`).

# What is Kibana?

Kibana is an open source data visualization plugin for Elasticsearch. It provides visualization capabilities on top of the content indexed on an Elasticsearch cluster. Users can create bar, line and scatter plots, or pie charts and maps on top of large volumes of data.

Kibana is a registered trademark of Elasticsearch BV.

# How to use this image

You can run the default `kibana` command simply:

```console
$ docker run --link some-elasticsearch:elasticsearch -d kibana
```

You can also pass in additional flags to `kibana`:

```console
$ docker run --link some-elasticsearch:elasticsearch -d kibana --plugins /somewhere/else
```

This image includes `EXPOSE 5601` ([default `port`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/5.2/settings.html)). If you'd like to be able to access the instance from the host without the container's IP, standard port mappings can be used:

```console
$ docker run --name some-kibana --link some-elasticsearch:elasticsearch -p 5601:5601 -d kibana
```

You can also provide the address of elasticsearch via `ELASTICSEARCH_URL` environnement variable:

```console
$ docker run --name some-kibana -e ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://some-elasticsearch:9200 -p 5601:5601 -d kibana
```

Then, access it via `http://localhost:5601` or `http://host-ip:5601` in a browser.

## ... via [`docker stack deploy`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stack_deploy/) or [`docker-compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose)

Example `stack.yml` for `kibana`:

```yaml
version: '3.1'

services:

    kibana:
        image: kibana
        ports:
            - 5601:5601

    elasticsearch:
        image: elasticsearch
```

Run `docker stack deploy -c stack.yml kibana` (or `docker-compose -f stack.yml up`), wait for it to initialize completely, and visit `http://swarm-ip:5601`, `http://localhost:5601`, or `http://host-ip:5601` (as appropriate).
