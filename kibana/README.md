# What is Kibana?

# How to use this image

You can run the default `kibana` command simply:

	docker run --link some-elasticsearch:elasticsearch -d kibana

You can also pass in additional flags to `kibana`:

	docker run --link some-elasticsearch:elasticsearch -d kibana --plugins /somewhere/else

This image includes `EXPOSE 5601` ([default `port`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/_setting_kibana_server_properties.html)). If you'd like to be able to access the instance from the host without the container's IP, standard port mappings can be used:

	docker run --name some-kibana --link some-elasticsearch:elasticsearch -p 5601:5601 -d kibana

Then, access it via `http://localhost:5601` or `http://host-ip:5601` in a browser.
