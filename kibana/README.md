# **DEPRECATED**

This image is officially deprecated in favor of [the `kibana` image provided by elastic.co](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/_pulling_the_image.html) which is available to pull via `docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:[version]` like `5.2.1`. This image will receive no further updates after 2017-06-20 (June 20, 2017). Please adjust your usage accordingly.

Elastic provides open-source support for Kibana via the [elastic/kibana GitHub repository](https://github.com/elastic/kibana) and the Docker image via the [elastic/kibana-docker GitHub repository](https://github.com/elastic/kibana-docker), as well as community support via its [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/kibana).

# What is Kibana?

Kibana is a registered trademark of Elasticsearch BV.

# How to use this image

You can run the default `kibana` command simply:

```console
$ docker run --link some-elasticsearch:elasticsearch -d kibana
```

You can also pass in additional flags to `kibana`:

```console
$ docker run --link some-elasticsearch:elasticsearch -d kibana --plugins /somewhere/else
```

This image includes `EXPOSE 5601` ([default `port`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/5.2/settings.html)). If you'd like to be able to access the instance from the host without the container's IP, standard port mappings can be used:

```console
$ docker run --name some-kibana --link some-elasticsearch:elasticsearch -p 5601:5601 -d kibana
```

You can also provide the address of elasticsearch via `ELASTICSEARCH_URL` environnement variable:

```console
$ docker run --name some-kibana -e ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://some-elasticsearch:9200 -p 5601:5601 -d kibana
```

Then, access it via `http://localhost:5601` or `http://host-ip:5601` in a browser.
