If you are a user/consumer of Java, this image is probably not what you expect!

These images contain "vanilla" builds of the OpenJDK project provided by [Oracle](https://jdk.java.net/) or [the relevant "updates project lead"](https://github.com/docker-library/openjdk/issues/320#issuecomment-494050246) (depending on the version).

For a more "supported" experience, we recommend one of the following other Official Images (listed in alphabetical order with no intentional or implied preference):
