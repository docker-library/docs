# What is MongoDB?

MongoDB (from "humongous") is a cross-platform document-oriented database.
Classified as a NoSQL database, MongoDB eschews the traditional table-based
relational database structure in favor of JSON-like documents with dynamic
schemas (MongoDB calls the format BSON), making the integration of data in
certain types of applications easier and faster. Released under a combination of
the GNU Affero General Public License and the Apache License, MongoDB is free
and open-source software.

First developed by the software company 10gen (now MongoDB Inc.) in October 2007
as a component of a planned platform as a service product, the company shifted
to an open source development model in 2009, with 10gen offering commercial
support and other services. Since then, MongoDB has been adopted as backend
software by a number of major websites and services, including Craigslist, eBay,
Foursquare, SourceForge, Viacom, and the New York Times, among others. MongoDB
is the most popular NoSQL database system.

# How to use this image

## start a mongo instance

    docker run --name some-mongo -d mongo

This image includes `EXPOSE 27017` (the mongo port), so standard container
linking will make it automatically available to the linked containers (as the
following examples illustrate).

## connect to it from an application

    docker run --name some-app --link some-mongo:mongo -d application-that-uses-mongo

## ... or via `mongo`

    docker run -it --link some-mongo:mongo --rm mongo sh -c 'exec mongo "$MONGO_PORT_27017_TCP_ADDR:$MONGO_PORT_27017_TCP_PORT/test"'

## Configuration

See the [official docs](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/) for infomation on using
and configuring MongoDB for things like replica sets and sharding.
