# What is Ruby on Rails?

Ruby on Rails or, simply, Rails is an open source web application framework which runs on the Ruby programming language. It is a full-stack framework. This means that "out of the box", Rails can create pages and applications that gather information from a web server, talk to or query a database, and render templates. As a result, Rails features a routing system that is independent of the web server.

# How to use this image

## Create a `Dockerfile` in your Rails app project

```dockerfile
FROM rails:onbuild
```

Put this file in the root of your app, next to the `Gemfile`.

This image includes multiple `ONBUILD` triggers which should cover most applications. The build will `COPY . /usr/src/app`, `RUN bundle install`, `EXPOSE 3000`, and set the default command to `rails server`.

You can then build and run the Docker image:

```console
$ docker build -t my-rails-app .
$ docker run --name some-rails-app -d my-rails-app
```

You can test it by visiting `http://container-ip:3000` in a browser or, if you need access outside the host, on port 8080:

```console
$ docker run --name some-rails-app -p 8080:3000 -d my-rails-app
```

You can then go to `http://localhost:8080` or `http://host-ip:8080` in a browser.

### Generate a `Gemfile.lock`

The `onbuild` tag expects a `Gemfile.lock` in your app directory. This `docker
run` will help you generate one. Run it in the root of your app, next to the `Gemfile`:

```console
$ docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/usr/src/app -w /usr/src/app ruby:2.1 bundle install
```

## Bootstrap a new Rails application

If you want to generate the scaffolding for a new Rails project, you can do the following:

```console
$ docker run -it --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "$PWD":/usr/src/app -w /usr/src/app rails rails new --skip-bundle webapp
```

This will create a sub-directory named `webapp` inside your current directory.

# Image Variants

The `rails` images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific use case.

## `rails:<version>`

This is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both as a throw away container (mount your source code and start the container to start your app), as well as the base to build other images off of.

## `rails:onbuild`

This image makes building derivative images easier. For most use cases, creating a `Dockerfile` in the base of your project directory with the line `FROM rails:onbuild` will be enough to create a stand-alone image for your project.

While the `onbuild` variant is really useful for "getting off the ground running" (zero to Dockerized in a short period of time), it's not recommended for long-term usage within a project due to the lack of control over *when* the `ONBUILD` triggers fire (see also [`docker/docker#5714`](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/5714), [`docker/docker#8240`](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/8240), [`docker/docker#11917`](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/11917)).

Once you've got a handle on how your project functions within Docker, you'll probably want to adjust your `Dockerfile` to inherit from a non-`onbuild` variant and copy the commands from the `onbuild` variant `Dockerfile` (moving the `ONBUILD` lines to the end and removing the `ONBUILD` keywords) into your own file so that you have tighter control over them and more transparency for yourself and others looking at your `Dockerfile` as to what it does. This also makes it easier to add additional requirements as time goes on (such as installing more packages before performing the previously-`ONBUILD` steps).
