# What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications
inside software containers, by providing an additional layer of abstraction and
automation of operating system–level virtualization on Linux. Docker uses
resource isolation features of the Linux kernel such as cgroups and kernel
namespaces to allow independent "containers" to run within a single Linux
instance, avoiding the overhead of starting virtual machines.
