# What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications
inside software containers, by providing an additional layer of abstraction and
automation of operating systemâ€“level virtualization on Linux. Docker uses
resource isolation features of the Linux kernel such as cgroups and kernel
namespaces to allow independent "containers" to run within a single Linux
instance, avoiding the overhead of starting virtual machines.
