Couchbase Server comes in two editions: Enterprise Edition and Community Edition. You can find details on the differences between the two and licensing information on the [Couchbase Server Editions](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/introduction/editions.html) page.

-	**Enterprise Edition** -- The Enterprise Edition license provides for free for development and testing for Couchbase Enterprise Edition. A paid subscription for production deployment is required. Please refer to the [pricing](https://www.couchbase.com/pricing) page for details on Couchbase's Enterprise Edition.

-	**Community Edition** -- The Community Edition license provides for free deployment of Couchbase Community Edition for departmental-scale deployments of up to five node clusters. It has recently been changed to disallow use of XDCR, which is now an exclusive Enterprise Edition feature.
