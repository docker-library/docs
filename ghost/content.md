# How to use this image

This will start a Ghost instance listening on the default Ghost port of 2368.

```console
$ docker run -d --name some-ghost %%IMAGE%%
```

## Custom port

If you'd like to be able to access the instance from the host without the container's IP, standard port mappings can be used:

```console
$ docker run -d --name some-ghost -p 3001:2368 %%IMAGE%%
```

Then, access it via `http://localhost:3001` or `http://host-ip:3001` in a browser.

### Upgrading Ghost

You will want to ensure you are running the latest minor version (1.25.5 or 0.11.9) of Ghost before upgrading major versions. Otherwise, you may run into database errors.

For upgrading your Ghost container you will want to mount your data to the appropriate path in the predecessor container (see below): import your content from the admin panel, stop the container, and then re-mount your content to the successor container you are upgrading into; you can then export your content from the admin panel.

## Stateful

Mount your existing content. In this example we also use the Alpine base image.

### Ghost 1.x.x

```console
$ docker run -d --name some-ghost -p 3001:2368 -v /path/to/ghost/blog:/var/lib/ghost/content %%IMAGE%%:1-alpine
```

### Ghost 0.11.xx

```console
$ docker run -d --name some-ghost -p 3001:2368 -v /path/to/ghost/blog:/var/lib/ghost %%IMAGE%%:0.11-alpine
```

### Docker Volume

Alternatively you can use a [data container](http://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/) that has a volume that points to `/var/lib/ghost/content` (or /var/lib/ghost for 0.11.x) and then reference it:

```console
$ docker run -d --name some-ghost --volumes-from some-ghost-data %%IMAGE%%
```

### SQLite Database

This Docker image for Ghost uses SQLite. There is nothing special to configure.

## Configuration

All Ghost configuration parameters (such as `url`) can be specified via environment variables. See [the Ghost documentation](https://docs.ghost.org/docs/config#section-running-ghost-with-config-env-variables) for details about what configuration is allowed and how to convert a nested configuration key into the appropriate environment variable name:

```console
$ docker run -d --name some-ghost -e url=http://some-ghost.example.com %%IMAGE%%
```

(There are further configuration examples in the `stack.yml` listed below.)

## What is the Node.js version?

When opening a ticket at https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues it becomes necessary to know the version of Node.js in use:

```console
$ docker exec <container-id> node --version
v6.11.2
```

## Note about Ghost-CLI

While the Docker images do have Ghost-CLI available and do use some of its commands to set up the base Ghost image, many of the other Ghost-CLI commands won't work correctly, and really aren't designed/intended to. For more info see [docker-library/ghost#156 (comment)](https://github.com/docker-library/ghost/issues/156#issuecomment-428159861)

## %%STACK%%

Run `docker stack deploy -c stack.yml %%REPO%%` (or `docker-compose -f stack.yml up`), wait for it to initialize completely, and visit `http://swarm-ip:8080`, `http://localhost:8080`, or `http://host-ip:8080` (as appropriate).
