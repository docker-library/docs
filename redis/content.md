# What is Redis?

Redis is the worldâ€™s fastest data platform. It provides cloud and on-prem solutions for caching, vector search, and NoSQL databases that seamlessly fit into any tech stack&mdash;making it simple for digital customers to build, scale, and deploy the fast apps our world runs on.

# Security

For the ease of accessing Redis from other containers via Docker networking, the "Protected mode" is turned off by default. This means that if you expose the port outside of your host (e.g., via `-p` on `docker run`), it will be open without a password to anyone. It is **highly** recommended to set a password (by supplying a config file) if you plan on exposing your Redis instance to the internet. For further information, see the following links about Redis security:

# How to use this image

## Start a redis instance

```console
$ docker run --name some-redis -d %%IMAGE%%
```

## Start with persistent storage

```console
$ docker run --name some-redis -d %%IMAGE%% redis-server --save 60 1 --loglevel warning
```

There are several different persistence strategies to choose from. This one will save a snapshot of the DB every 60 seconds if at least 1 write operation was performed (it will also lead to more logs, so the `loglevel` option may be desirable). If persistence is enabled, data is stored in the `VOLUME /data`, which can be used with `--volumes-from some-volume-container` or `-v /docker/host/dir:/data` (see [docs.docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/)).

For more about Redis persistence, see [the official Redis documentation](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence/).

## Connecting via `redis-cli`

```console
$ docker run -it --network some-network --rm %%IMAGE%% redis-cli -h some-redis
```

## Additionally, if you want to use your own redis.conf ...

You can create your own Dockerfile that adds a redis.conf from the context into /data/, like so.

```dockerfile
FROM %%IMAGE%%
COPY redis.conf /usr/local/etc/redis/redis.conf
CMD [ "redis-server", "/usr/local/etc/redis/redis.conf" ]
```

Alternatively, you can specify something along the same lines with `docker run` options.

```console
$ docker run -v /myredis/conf:/usr/local/etc/redis --name myredis %%IMAGE%% redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis/redis.conf
```

Where `/myredis/conf/` is a local directory containing your `redis.conf` file. Using this method means that there is no need for you to have a Dockerfile for your redis container.

The mapped directory should be writable, as depending on the configuration and mode of operation, Redis may need to create additional configuration files or rewrite existing ones.

## `32bit` variant

This variant is *not* a 32bit image (and will not run on 32bit hardware), but includes Redis compiled as a 32bit binary, especially for users who need the decreased memory requirements associated with that. See ["Using 32 bit instances"](http://redis.io/topics/memory-optimization#using-32-bit-instances) in the Redis documentation for more information.

# Redis Stack and modules

Modules extend Redis with extra capabilities. Redis Stack already comes with the capabilities (search and query, JSON support, and more) that are developed by Redis (the company). The Docker images are available here:

-	[Redis Stack](https://hub.docker.com/r/redis/redis-stack): Redis plus extra capabilities and Redis Insight (a GUI for Redis)
-	[Redis Stack Server](https://hub.docker.com/r/redis/redis-stack-server): Redis plus extra capabilities

You can find the list of modules for Redis on [redis.io](https://redis.io/community/redis-modules-hub/).
