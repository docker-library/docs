# What is Odoo?

Odoo, formerly known as OpenERP, is a suite of open-source business apps written in Python and released under the AGPL license. This suite of applications covers all business needs, from Website/Ecommerce down to manufacturing, inventory and accounting, all seamlessly integrated. It is the first time ever a software editor managed to reach such a functional coverage. Odoo is the most installed business software in the world. Odoo is used by 2.000.000 users worldwide ranging from very small companies (1 user) to very large ones (300 000 users).

# How to use this image

This image requires a running PostgreSQL server.

## Start a PostgreSQL server

```console
$ docker run -d -e POSTGRES_USER=odoo -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=odoo --name db postgres:9.6
```

## Start an Odoo instance

```console
$ docker run -p 8069:8069 --name odoo --link db:db -t odoo
```

The alias of the container running Postgres must be db for Odoo to be able to connect to the Postgres server.

## Stop and restart an Odoo instance

```console
$ docker stop odoo
$ docker start -a odoo
```

## Stop and restart a PostgreSQL server

When a PostgreSQL server is restarted, the Odoo instances linked to that server must be restarted as well because the server address has changed and the link is thus broken.

Restarting a PostgreSQL server does not affect the created databases.

## Run Odoo with a custom configuration

The default configuration file for the server (located at `/etc/odoo/openerp-server.conf`) can be overriden at startup using volumes. Suppose you have a custom configuration at `/path/to/config/openerp-server.conf`, then

```console
$ docker run -v /path/to/config:/etc/odoo -p 8069:8069 --name odoo --link db:db -t odoo
```

Please use [this configuration template](https://github.com/odoo/docker/blob/master/8.0/openerp-server.conf) to write your custom configuration as we already set some arguments for running Odoo inside a Docker container.

You can also directly specify Odoo arguments inline. Those arguments must be given after the keyword `--` in the command-line, as follows

```console
$ docker run -p 8069:8069 --name odoo --link db:db -t odoo -- --db-filter=odoo_db_.*
```

## Mount custom addons

You can mount your own Odoo addons within the Odoo container, at `/mnt/extra-addons`

```console
$ docker run -v /path/to/addons:/mnt/extra-addons -p 8069:8069 --name odoo --link db:db -t odoo
```

## Run multiple Odoo instances

```console
$ docker run -p 8070:8069 --name odoo2 --link db:db -t odoo
$ docker run -p 8071:8069 --name odoo3 --link db:db -t odoo
```

Please note that for plain use of mails and reports functionalities, when the host and container ports differ (e.g. 8070 and 8069), one has to set, in Odoo, Settings->Parameters->System Parameters (requires technical features), web.base.url to the container port (e.g. 127.0.0.1:8069).

## Use with Docker Compose

The Odoo Docker image has some environment variables (with default values) that you can set to fit your needs:

-	`HOST`: the name of the "host" or address of the PostgreSQL database inside the Odoo container. By default it's: `db`.
-	`PORT`: the port in where that database container is listening. By default it's the standard PostgreSQL port: `5432`.
-	`USER`: the user that you gave to the PostgreSQL database container (the same as `POSTGRES_USER` in the database container). By default it's: `odoo`. Currently it is required that the name of the user you give to the PostgreSQL and Odoo container is "`odoo`", see [issue#10377](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/10377).
-	`PASSWORD`: the password that you gave to the PostgreSQL database container (the same as `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in the database container). By default it's: `odoo`.

So, a `docker-compose.yml` file could contain just:

```yml
version: '2'
services:
  web:
    image: odoo:10
    depends_on:
      - db
    ports:
      - "8069:8069"
  db:
    image: postgres:9.6
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=odoo
      - POSTGRES_USER=odoo
```

This previous `docker-compose.yml` would be using the defaults for all the environment variables.

If you needed to modify the environment variables it could look like:


```yml
version: '2'
services:
  web:
    image: odoo:10
    depends_on:
      - mydb
    ports:
      - "8069:8069"
    environment:
    - HOST=mydb
    - USER=odoo
    - PASSWORD=myodoo

  mydb:
    image: postgres:9.6
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=odoo
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=myodoo
```

If you use volumes for the data of the database and the odoo files, and also mount directories with addons and configurations a `docker-compose.yml` file could be:

```yml
version: '2'
services:
  web:
    image: odoo:9
    depends_on:
      - db
    ports:
      - "8069:8069"
    volumes:
      - odoo-web-data:/var/lib/odoo
      - ./config:/etc/odoo
      - ./addons:/mnt/extra-addons
  db:
    image: postgres:9.6
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=odoo
      - POSTGRES_USER=odoo
      - PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
    volumes:
      - odoo-db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
volumes:
  odoo-web-data:
  odoo-db-data:
```

Then you can start your stack from the same directory with the `docker-compose.yml` file with:

```console
docker-compose up -d
```

# How to upgrade this image

Odoo images are updated on a regular basis to make them use recent releases (a new release of each version of Odoo is built [every night](http://nightly.odoo.com/)). Please be aware that what follows is about upgrading from an old release to the latest one provided of the same major version, as upgrading from a major version to another is a much more complex process requiring elaborated migration scripts (see [Odoo Enterprise Upgrade page](https://upgrade.odoo.com/database/upload) or this [community project](https://doc.therp.nl/openupgrade/) which aims to write those scripts).

Suppose you created a database from an Odoo instance named old-odoo, and you want to access this database from a new Odoo instance named new-odoo, e.g. because you've just downloaded a newer Odoo image.

By default, Odoo 8.0 uses a filestore (located at /var/lib/odoo/filestore/) for attachments. You should restore this filestore in your new Odoo instance by running

```console
$ docker run --volumes-from old-odoo -p 8070:8069 --name new-odoo --link db:db -t odoo
```

You can also simply prevent Odoo from using the filestore by setting the system parameter `ir_attachment.location` to `db-storage` in Settings->Parameters->System Parameters (requires technical features).
