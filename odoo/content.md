# What is Odoo?

Odoo, formerly known as OpenERP, is a suite of open-source business apps written in Python and released under the AGPL license. This suite of applications covers all business needs, from Website/Ecommerce down to manufacturing, inventory and accounting, all seamlessly integrated. It is the first time ever a software editor managed to reach such a functional coverage. Odoo is the most installed business software in the world. Odoo is used by 2.000.000 users worldwide ranging from very small companies (1 user) to very large ones (300 000 users).

# How to use this image

This image requires a running PostgreSQL server.

## Start a PostgreSQL server

	docker run -d -e POSTGRES_USER=odoo -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=odoo --name db postgres

## Start an Odoo instance

	docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8069:8069 --name odoo --link db:db -t odoo

The alias of the container running Postgres must be db for Odoo to be able to connect to the Postgres server.

## Stop and restart an Odoo instance

	docker stop odoo
	docker start -a odoo

## Stop and restart a PostgreSQL server

When a PostgreSQL server is restarted, the Odoo instances linked to that server must be restarted as well because the server address has changed and the link is thus broken.

Restarting a PostgreSQL server does not affect the created databases.

## Run Odoo with a custom configuration

The default configuration file for the server (located at `/etc/odoo/openerp-server.conf`) can be overriden at startup using volumes. Suppose you have a custom configuration at `/path/to/config/openerp-server.conf`, then

	docker run -v /path/to/config:/etc/odoo -p 127.0.0.1:8069:8069 --name odoo --link db:db -t odoo

Please use [this configuration template](https://github.com/odoo/docker/blob/master/8.0/openerp-server.conf)
to write your custom configuration as we already set some arguments for running
Odoo inside a Docker container.

You can also directly specify Odoo arguments inline. Those arguments must be
given after the keyword `--` in the command-line, as follows

	docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8069:8069 --name odoo --link db:db -t odoo -- --dbfilter=odoo_db_.*

## Mount custom addons

You can mount your own Odoo addons within the Odoo container, at `/mnt/extra-addons`

	docker run -v /path/to/addons:/mnt/extra-addons -p 127.0.0.1:8069:8069 --name odoo --link db:db -t odoo

## Run multiple Odoo instances

	docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8070:8069 --name odoo2 --link db:db -t odoo
	docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8071:8069 --name odoo3 --link db:db -t odoo

Please note that for plain use of mails and reports functionalities, when the host and container ports differ (e.g. 8070 and 8069), one has to set, in Odoo, Settings->Parameters->System Parameters (requires technical features), web.base.url to the container port (e.g. 127.0.0.1:8069).

# How to upgrade this image

Suppose you created a database from an Odoo instance named old-odoo, and you want to access this database from a new Odoo instance named new-odoo, e.g. because you've just downloaded a newer Odoo image.

By default, Odoo 8.0 uses a filestore (located at /var/lib/odoo/filestore/)
for attachments. You should restore this filestore in your new Odoo instance by
running

	docker run --volumes-from old-odoo -p 127.0.0.1:8070:8069 --name new-odoo --link db:db -t odoo

You can also simply prevent Odoo from using the filestore by setting the system parameter `ir_attachment.location` to `db-storage` in Settings->Parameters->System Parameters (requires technical features).
