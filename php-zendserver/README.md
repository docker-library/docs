# What is Zend Server?

Zend Server is the integrated application platform for PHP mobile and web apps. Zend Server provides you with a highly available PHP production environment which includes, amongst other features, a highly reliable PHP stack, application monitoring, troubleshooting, and the all-new Z-Ray.

### Boost your Development with Z-Ray

Using Zend Server Z-Ray is akin to wearing X-Ray goggles, effortlessly giving developers deep insight into how their code is running as they are developing it – all without having to change any of their habits or workflow. With Z-Ray, developers can immediately understand the impact of their code changes, enabling them to both improve quality and solve issues long before their code reaches production. In addition to the obvious benefits of this ‘Left Shifting’ – better performance, fewer production issues and faster recovery times – using Z-Ray is also downright fun!

### Powering Continuous Delivery

Zend Server is the platform that enables Continuous Delivery, which provides consistency, automation and collaboration capabilities throughout the application delivery cycle. Patterns are available to integrate Zend Server with: Chef, Jenkins, Nagios, Vmware, Puppet.

# PHP-ZendServer

This is a cluster-enabled version of a Dockerized Zend Server container. With Zend Server on Docker, you'll get your PHP applications up and running on a highly available PHP production environment which includes, amongst other features, a highly reliable PHP stack, application monitoring, troubleshooting, and the new and innovative new technology - Z-Ray. Z-Ray gives developers unprecedented visibility into their code by tracking and displaying in a toolbar live and detailed info on how the various elements constructing their page are performing.

For development purposes we provide you with a time limited trial license. For production use you must provide a valid Zend Server license using the instructions below in the Usage section.

## Usage

#### Launching the Container from Docker-Hub

Zend Server is shared on [Docker-Hub] as **php-zendserver**.

##### Single instance

To start a single Zend Server instance, execute:

	    $ docker run arm32v7/php-zendserver

-	You can specify the PHP and Zend Server version by adding ':<php-version>' or ':&lt;ZS-version&gt;-php&lt;version&gt;' to the 'docker run' command.

		for example: 
		$docker run arm32v7/php-zendserver:8.5-php5.6

#### Availible versions:

-	Zend Server 8
-	Zend Server 9 (With PHP 7 GA)(Default version)
-	Zend Server 2019 with multi PHP Version Support (7.1, 7.2 & 7.3)

##### Cluster

To start a Zend Server cluster, execute the following command for each cluster node:

	    $ docker run -e MYSQL_HOSTNAME=<db-ip> -e MYSQL_PORT=3306 -e MYSQL_USERNAME=<username> -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=<password> -e MYSQL_DBNAME=zend arm32v7/php-zendserver

#### Bring your own license

To use your own Zend Server license: $ docker run arm32v7/php-zendserver -e ZEND_LICENSE_KEY=<license-key> -e ZEND_LICENSE_ORDER=<order-number>

#### Launching the Container from Dockerfile

From a local folder containing this repo's clone, execute the following command to generate the image. The **image-id** will be outputted:

	    $ docker build .

##### Single instance from custom image

To start a single Zend Server instance, execute:

	    $ docker run <image-id>

#### Cluster from custom image

To start a Zend Server cluster, execute the following command on each cluster node:

	    $ docker run -e MYSQL_HOSTNAME=<db-ip> -e MYSQL_PORT=3306 -e MYSQL_USERNAME=<username> -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=<password> -e MYSQL_DBNAME=zend <image-id>

#### Accessing Zend server

Once started, the container will output the information required to access the PHP application and the Zend Server UI, including an automatically generated admin password.

#### Port forwarding (For remote access)

To access the container **remotely**, port forwarding must be configured, either manually or using docker. For example, this command redirects port 80 to port 88, and port 10081 (Zend Server UI port) to port 10088:

	    $ docker run -p 88:80 -p 10088:10081 arm32v7/php-zendserver

##### For clustered instances:

To start a Zend Server cluster you must provide a Mysql compatible database:

	    $ docker run -p 88:80 -p 10088:10081 -e MYSQL_HOSTNAME=<db-ip> -e MYSQL_PORT=3306 -e MYSQL_USERNAME=<username> -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=<password> -e MYSQL_DBNAME=zend <image-id>

Please note, when running multiple instances only one instance can be bound to a port. If you are running a cluster, either assign a port redirect to one node only, or assign a different port to each container.

#### Adding application files

Application files can be automatically pulled from a Git repo by setting the **GIT_URL** env var to the repo's URL. Alternatively, if building an image from Dockerfile, place the app files in the "app/" folder.

The files will be copied to the containers /var/www/html folder and defined in Zend Server as the default app. An example index.html file is included. this feature is available in Zend Server 8 and above.

#### Env variables

Env variables are passed in the run command with the "-e" switch.

##### Optional env-variables:

To specify a pre-defined admin password for Zend Server use:

-	ZS\_ADMIN\_PASSWORD

Automatically Deploy an app from Git URL:

-	GIT\_URL

MySQL vars for clustered ops. *ALL* are required for the node to properly join a cluster:

-	MYSQL\_HOSTNAME - ip or hostname of MySQL database
-	MYSQL\_PORT - MySQL listening port
-	MYSQL\_USERNAME
-	MYSQL\_PASSWORD
-	MYSQL\_DBNAME - Name of the database Zend Server will use for cluster ops (created automatically if it does not exist).

To specify a pre-purchased license use the following env vars:

-	ZEND\_LICENSE\_KEY
-	ZEND\_LICENSE\_ORDER

Set Zend Server to production mode by setting the following env var to "true". By default Zend Server is set to "development mode" with Z-Ray enabled:

-	ZS\_PRODUCTION

### Minimal Requirements

Each Zend Server Docker container requires 1GB of availible memory.
