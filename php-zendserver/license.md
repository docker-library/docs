End-User License Agreement

This End-User License Agreement (this "Agreement") is a legal contract between
you, as either an individual or a single business entity, and Zend Technologies
Ltd. and its affiliates ("Zend").

READ THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE DOWNLOADING OR
INSTALLING ZEND'S PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE (THE "SOFTWARE") OR OBTAINING A LICENSE
KEY TO THE SOFTWARE OR USING THE SOFTWARE. THE SOFTWARE IS FURTHER DEFINED IN
AN ORDER DOCUMENT (AN "ORDER"), ENTERED INTO BETWEEN YOU AND ZEND OR YOU AND A
ZEND RESELLER, WHICH SETS FORTH COMMERCIAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO YOUR PURCHASE OF
THE SOFTWARE. THE SOFTWARE IS COPYRIGHTED AND IT IS LICENSED TO YOU UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT AND IS NOT SOLD TO YOU. BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING OR USING THE
SOFTWARE OR OBTAINING A LICENSE KEY TO THE SOFTWARE, OR BY ENTERING INTO AN
ORDER WHICH REFERENCES AND PROVIDES SOURCE INFORMATION NECESSARY FOR ACCESSING
AND REVIEWING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS
AGREEMENT, THAT YOU UNDERSTAND IT, AND THAT YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY
ITS TERMS. IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT,
YOU SHOULD TERMINATE THE DOWNLOAD OR INSTALLATION PROCESS, AND REFRAIN FROM
ACCESSING OR USING THE SOFTWARE. THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY ORDERS,
REPRESENTS THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND ZEND CONCERNING THE SOFTWARE,
AND THIS AGREEMENT SUPERSEDES AND REPLACES ANY PRIOR PROPOSAL, REPRESENTATION,
OR UNDERSTANDING YOU MAY HAVE HAD WITH ZEND RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE UNLESS YOU
HAVE ENTERED INTO A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT SIGNED BY ZEND THAT EXPRESSLY
AMENDS THIS AGREEMENT.

1. License

1.1. Grant of License

Zend hereby grants to you, and you accept, a limited, nonexclusive,
non-transferable license to use the Software in machine-readable, object code
form only, and the user manuals accompanying the Software (the
"Documentation"), only as authorized in this Agreement, and subject to
compliance with the terms of this Agreement, and payment of all applicable
license fees. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Software" includes any
updates, enhancements, modifications, revisions, or additions to the Software
made available to you by Zend. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Zend shall be
under no obligation to provide any updates, enhancements, modifications,
revisions, or additions to the Software. The term of your license is as set
forth in the Order. If the Order does not state a term, then the term of the
license shall be for a period of one (1) year from the earlier of your download
or installation of the Software. The term of your license is renewable on terms
set forth in the Order or otherwise as agreed by Zend.

1.2. Scope of Use

You may use the Software activated by a license key for the number of computers
(virtual or physical) owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by you, at rates
specified for metered usage or for the number of users, as specified in an
Order. An Order may also specify other applicable license scope definitions.
For purposes of this Agreement, "use" of the Software means loading the
Software into the temporary or permanent memory of a computer and executing the
Software. If you distribute the Software to multiple computers or users, you
must ensure that your usage does not exceed the usage for which you have paid
license fees, or you will be in breach of this Agreement unless the order is
for meter use. If the Order does not state a scope of license, then the scope
of license for the Software shall be for a single user on a single computer or
shall be metered at the applicable rate.

1.3. Restrictions, Copies and Modifications

You may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise translate
the Software or any license keys you have obtained. You may not modify or adapt
the Software or any license keys that you have obtained in any way. You may
make one copy of the Software, the Documentation, and any license keys that you
have obtained, solely for backup or archival purposes. Any such copies of the
Software, Documentation, or license keys shall include any copyright or other
proprietary notices that were included on such materials when you first
received them. Except as authorized in this Section, no copies of the Software,
Documentation, or license keys, or any portions thereof, may be made or
distributed by you or any person under your authority or control. You may not
allow third party use of the Software or use of the Software as a service
bureau.

1.4. Assignment of Rights

You will not sublicense, lease, rent, or lend your rights in the Software,
Documentation, or license keys, as granted by this Agreement, to any party
without prior written consent of Zend.

1.5. Product Specific Special Terms

The provisions of this Section are applicable to the specific product mentioned
and are exceptions to other provisions of this Agreement, and serve to modify
such provisions only to the extent such provisions relate to these products.

Zend Server - There are multiple editions of Zend Server, each with different
functionality and Service Level Agreements (SLA). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, you are permitted to duplicate and
distribute the Zend Server product, on a standalone basis or combined with
other products, provided (i) you do not make any modifications to Zend Server
and distribute the entire Zend Server product, (ii) you do not modify or remove
any proprietary rights notices or markings, or remove or modify this Agreement
as included in any such distribution, (iii) you clearly indicate that Zend
Server is included in your distribution, (iv) you do not use Zend's name, logos
or trademarks or the name, logos and trademarks of any included third party
software in any way that might state or imply Zend's or a third party's
endorsement of your product, and (v) you do not transfer with any such copy any
license keys for Zend Server. You are not allowed to operate Zend Server
without a valid license.

Zend Server Developer Edition - Zend Server Developer Edition is limited to use
in Development and may not be used in Production.

Zend Studio - Zend Studio is not available for you to distribute. If the
license key for Zend Studio expires and is not renewed for a subscription or
limited term license, Zend Studio will continue to operate with only reduced
functionality. This reduced functionality version is licensed on a perpetual
basis, without charge, subject to compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

Zend Guard - Zend Guard is not available for you to distribute. However, you
may distribute Zend Optimizer and Zend Guard Loader (the runtime c components
for encoded files) to your end customers, provided that your end user customers
enter into an end user agreement that contains at a minimum the following
provisions covering the Zend embedded components: (i) prohibits reverse
compilation and/or reverse assembly, (ii) disclaims all warranties, and (iii)
disclaims liability for any indirect, incidental or consequential damages.

2. Intellectual Property Protection and Confidentiality

2.1. Use Reporting, License Violations and Remedies

Zend reserves the right to gather data on license key usage including license
key numbers, server IP addresses, domain counts and other information deemed
relevant, to ensure that our products are being used in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. Additionally, you agree that Zend may, upon reasonable
notice, perform an audit of your facilities to verify compliance with the terms
of this Agreement. Any unauthorized use shall be considered by Zend to be a
violation of this Agreement. Zend reserves the right to remedy violations
immediately upon discovery, by charging the then-current list price of
unauthorized license keys. This is not a sole remedy for a violation of this
Agreement and Zend may exercise any other remedies available at equity or law.

2.2. License Automatic Update and Expiration

Your license may include an expiration date that can result in the termination
of the license. There is no expiration date for perpetual license keys, 
however upgrades and support are only available if you purchase support
from Zend. Zend may terminate your license if it determines that a license is
used in violation of the terms of this Agreement. If your license key is
stolen, or if you suspect any improper or illegal usage of your license key
outside of your control you should promptly notify Zend of such occurrence. A
replacement license will be issued to you and the suspect license will be
allowed to expire. For limited-term licenses, your periodic payment must be
processed prior to the expiration date in order for the license updates to be
performed. It is your responsibility to contact Zend regarding any potential
expiration that you deem inappropriate. Zend shall not be liable for any
damages or costs incurred in connection with the expired licenses.

2.3. Proprietary Rights to Software and Trademarks

You acknowledge that the Software and the Documentation are proprietary to
Zend, and the Software and Documentation are protected under United States
copyright law and international treaties. You further acknowledge and agree
that, as between you and Zend, Zend owns and shall continue to own all right,
title, and interest in and to the Software and Documentation, including
associated intellectual property rights under copyright, trade secret, patent,
or trademark laws. This Agreement does not grant you any ownership interest in
or to the Software or the Documentation, but only a limited right of use that
is revocable in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Any and all
trademarks or service marks that Zend uses in connection with the Software or
with services rendered by Zend are marks owned by Zend. This Agreement does not
grant you any right, license, or interest in such marks, and you shall not
assert any right, license, or interest in such marks or any words or designs
that are confusingly similar to such marks.

2.4. Confidentiality

You shall permit only authorized users, who possess rightfully obtained license
keys, to use the Software or to view the Documentation. Except as expressly
authorized by this Agreement, you shall not make available the Software,
Documentation, or any license key to any third party. You will use your best
efforts to cooperate with and assist Zend in identifying and preventing any
unauthorized use, copying, or disclosure of the Software, Documentation, or any
portion thereof.

3. License Fees

The Software will be available to you for use upon your receipt of a license
key. You may obtain one or more license keys by ordering the license keys from
Zend or a Zend reseller, as the case may be. The license fees paid by you for
the license keys are paid in consideration of the license granted under this
Agreement. You shall, in addition to license fees, pay all applicable sales,
use, transfer, or other taxes and all duties, whether national, state, or
local, however designated, that are levied or imposed by reason of your
purchase and use of the Software, excluding income taxes on the net profits of
Zend.

4. Software Maintenance and Support Services

Zend Server Products are available only on a subscription basis. There are
multiple versions of Zend Server, each with different functionality and SLA.

For Zend Studio and Zend Guard, you may elect to purchase Software upgrade and
support services by so ordering from Zend or a Zend reseller and paying the
applicable fees. 

5. Term and Termination 

This Agreement is effective upon your acceptance of the Agreement, or upon your
downloading, installing, accessing, or using the Software, even if you have not
expressly accepted this Agreement. This Agreement shall continue in effect
until terminated. Without prejudice to any other rights, this Agreement will
terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of the limitations or
other requirements described herein. If you are licensing the Software on a
limited term basis, and fail to pay the applicable license fees or renewal
license fees, Zend shall have the right to interrupt your use of the Software.
You may terminate this Agreement at any time by: (i) providing written notice
of your decision to terminate the Agreement to Zend and (ii) either returning
the Software, Documentation, all copies thereof, and all license keys that you
have obtained to Zend or destroying all such materials and providing written
verification of such destruction to Zend. Zend may terminate this License
Agreement if you breach any term of the Agreement by giving you written notice
of your breach and Zend's decision to terminate the Agreement. Upon termination
of this Agreement, you agree to either return to Zend the Software,
Documentation, all copies thereof, and all license keys that you have obtained,
or to destroy all such materials and provide written verification of such
destruction to Zend.

6. Indemnifications

Zend shall, at its expense, defend and indemnify you for damages and reasonable
costs finally incurred in any suit or claim brought against you alleging that
the Software infringes any U.S. patent, copyright, trade secret or similar
right, provided that Zend is promptly notified, rendered reasonable assistance
by you as required, and permitted to direct the defense or settlement
negotiations. Zend shall have no obligation to defend or indemnify any
infringement claim that arises from or relates to: (i) a modification of the
Software by you or any third party, (ii) a combination of the Software with
other software products, components, processes or materials, (iii) your failure
to incorporate or implement modifications directed by Zend, (iv) third party or
open source software components, (v) use of the Software in a manner
inconsistent with the Documentation, or (vi) any Software provided for
evaluation or trial use or marked as beta or early access. Should the use of
Software by you be enjoined, or in the event Zend wishes to minimize its
potential liability hereunder, Zend may, at its option, either: (i) substitute
fully equivalent non-infringing software; (ii) modify the infringing Software
so that it no longer infringes but remains functionally equivalent; (iii)
obtain for you, at Zend's expense, the right to continue use of the Software;
or (iv) take back the infringing Software and refund to you pre-paid license
fees applicable to the remainder of the license term, or if a perpetual license
was purchased, the purchase price paid, less depreciation amortized on a
three-year straight line basis. This indemnification sets forth Zend's sole
liability and your sole remedy for claims of infringement arising from your use
of the Software. You will, at your own expense, indemnify and hold Zend, and
its subsidiaries and affiliates, and all officers, directors, and employees
thereof, harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, liabilities,
losses, damages, judgments, grants, costs, and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, arising out of any use of the Software by you, any party
related to you, or any party acting upon your authorization in a manner that is
not expressly authorized by this Agreement. Your indemnification does not
include claims of infringement that are covered by Zend's indemnification
above.

7. Warranty; Disclaimer

Zend warrants for a period of thirty (30) days from your receipt of the
Software that the Software will materially conform to the Documentation. This
warranty covers only problems that are reproducible and verifiable and does not
cover software, or other items or any services provided by any persons other
than Zend. Maintenance and support, if any, are governed by a separate
agreement. Software, which has been abused, misused, damaged, modified, or
subjected to unauthorized use or installation, used in a manner inconsistent
with the Documentation or used with components not authorized by Zend, shall
void this warranty. Zend's sole liability (and your sole and exclusive remedy)
for any breach of this warranty shall be, in Zend's sole discretion, to use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with an error-correction or
workaround which corrects the reported non-conformity, or if Zend, in its sole
discretion, determines such remedies to be impracticable within a reasonable
period of time, to provide a refund of the fees paid for the Software. This
limited warranty does not apply for any Software provided for evaluation or
trial use or marked as beta or early access.

EXCEPT AS SET FORTH ABOVE IN THIS SECTION, THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION ARE
LICENSED "AS IS," AND ZEND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT, TO THE
EXTENT AUTHORIZED BY LAW. WITHOUT LIMITATION OF THE FOREGOING, ZEND EXPRESSLY
DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT
OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE. YOU ASSUME
RESPONSIBILITY FOR SELECTING THE SOFTWARE TO ACHIEVE YOUR INTENDED RESULTS, AND
FOR THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE. YOU SHALL BEAR THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE.

WARNING: The Software is not designed or intended for use in on-line control of
equipment in hazardous environments such as the operation of nuclear
facilities, aircraft, air traffic, aircraft navigation or aircraft
communications, or in the design, construction, operation or maintenance of any
nuclear facility, or in the operation or maintenance of any direct life support
system. Zend disclaims any express or implied warranty of fitness for such uses
and shall not be liable for any costs, liabilities or damages resulting from
the use of the Software in such an environment. You agree that you will not use
or license the Software for such purposes.

8. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT WILL ZEND BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR INDIRECT
DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOSS OF DATA, OR LOSS OF PROFITS OR
LOST SAVINGS, ARISING OUT OF USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR
DOCUMENTATION, EVEN IF ZEND HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL ZEND BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF
THE FEES PAID TO ZEND FOR THE SOFTWARE WITHIN THE PERIOD OF TWELVE (12) MONTHS
PRIOR TO ANY CLAIM ARISING.
