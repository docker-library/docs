This image has been deprecated in favor of the [official `elasticsearch` image](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html) provided and maintained by [elastic.co](https://www.elastic.co/). The upstream images are available to pull via `docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:[version]` like `5.4.2`. The images found here will receive no further updates once the `5.6.0` release is available upstream. Please adjust your usage accordingly.

Elastic provides open-source support for Elasticsearch via the [elastic/elasticsearch GitHub repository](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) and the Docker image via the [elastic/elasticsearch-docker GitHub repository](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-docker), as well as community support via its [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch).
