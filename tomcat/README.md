# What is Tomcat?

Apache Tomcat (or simply Tomcat) is an open source web server and servlet
container developed by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Tomcat implements
the Java Servlet and the JavaServer Pages (JSP) specifications from Oracle, and
provides a "pure Java" HTTP web server environment for Java code to run in. In
the simplest config Tomcat runs in a single operating system process. The
process runs a Java virtual machine (JVM). Every single HTTP request from a
browser to Tomcat is processed in the Tomcat process in a separate thread.

# How to use this image.

Run the default Tomcat server (`CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]`):

    docker run -it --rm tomcat:8.0

You can test it by visiting `http://container-ip:8080` in a browser or, if you
need access outside the host, on port 8888:

    docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8080 tomcat:8.0

You can then go to `http://localhost:8888` or `http://host-ip:8888` in a
browser.

The default Tomcat environment in the image for versions 7 and 8 is:

    CATALINA_BASE:   /usr/local/tomcat
    CATALINA_HOME:   /usr/local/tomcat
    CATALINA_TMPDIR: /usr/local/tomcat/temp
    JRE_HOME:        /usr
    CLASSPATH:       /usr/local/tomcat/bin/bootstrap.jar:/usr/local/tomcat/bin/tomcat-juli.jar

The default Tomcat environment in the image for version 6 is:

    CATALINA_BASE:   /usr/local/tomcat
    CATALINA_HOME:   /usr/local/tomcat
    CATALINA_TMPDIR: /usr/local/tomcat/temp
    JRE_HOME:        /usr
    CLASSPATH:       /usr/local/tomcat/bin/bootstrap.jar

The configuration files are available in `/usr/local/tomcat/conf/`.  By default,
no user is included in the "manager-gui" role required to operate the
"/manager/html" web application.   If you wish to use this app, you must define
such a user in `tomcat-users.xml`.
