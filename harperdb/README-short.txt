HarperDB is a database built to run on the edge making it the ideal IoT
database. It has the same code base and same features from the edge to the
cloud. The product is built with simplicity in mind, enabling solutions to be
built without worrying about the complexity of database architectures.
HarperDB offers standards based interfaces that developers already know (REST,
SQL, NoSQL, JSON) which allows them to rapidly build on a scalable and unified
architecture.  The simplicity of architecture and dynamic schema allows for a
reduction of compute resources and ease of management.
