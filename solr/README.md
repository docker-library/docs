# What is Solr?

Solr is the blazing-fast, open source, multi-modal search platform built on Apache Lucene. It powers full-text, vector, analytics, and geospatial search at many of the world's largest organizations. Other major features include Kubernetes integration, streaming, highlighting, faceting, and spellchecking.

Learn more on [Apache Solr homepage](http://solr.apache.org/) and in the [Apache Solr Reference Guide](https://solr.apache.org/guide/).

# How to use this Docker image

Full documentation can be found in the [Solr Reference Guide's Docker section](https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/deployment-guide/solr-in-docker.html).

To run a single Solr server:

```console
$ docker run -p 8983:8983 -t ppc64le/solr
```

Then with a web browser go to http://localhost:8983/ to see the Solr Admin Console.

# About this repository

This repository is available on [github.com/apache/solr-docker](https://github.com/apache/solr-docker), but the image is built and maintained in the official Solr repo [github.com/apache/solr](https://github.com/apache/solr).

Please direct any usage questions to the [Solr users mailing list](https://solr.apache.org/community.html#mailing-lists-chat).

# History

This project was started in 2015 by [Martijn Koster](https://github.com/makuk66) in the [github.com/docker-solr/docker-solr](https://github.com/docker-solr/docker-solr) repository. In 2019, the maintainership and copyright was transferred to the Apache Solr project. Many thanks to Martijn for all your contributions over the years!

# Image Variants

The `ppc64le/solr` images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific use case.

## `ppc64le/solr:<version>`

This is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both as a throw away container (mount your source code and start the container to start your app), as well as the base to build other images off of.

## `ppc64le/solr:<version>-slim`

This image does not contain the common packages contained in the default tag and only contains the minimal packages needed to run `ppc64le/solr`. Unless you are working in an environment where *only* the `ppc64le/solr` image will be deployed and you have space constraints, we highly recommend using the default image of this repository.
