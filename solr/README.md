# What is Solr?

Apache Solrâ„¢ is the popular, blazing fast, open source NoSQL search platform. Its major features include powerful full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic clustering, database integration, rich document handling, and geospatial search. Solr is highly scalable, providing fault tolerant distributed search and indexing, and powers the search and navigation features of many of the world's largest websites.

Learn more on [Apache Solr homepage](http://solr.apache.org/) and in the [Apache Solr Reference Guide](https://solr.apache.org/guide/).

# How to use this Docker image

Full documentation can be found in the [Solr Reference Guide's Docker section](https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/deployment-guide/solr-in-docker.html).

To run a single Solr server:

```console
$ docker run -p 8983:8983 -t solr
```

Then with a web browser go to http://localhost:8983/ to see the Solr Admin Console.

# About this repository

This repository is available on [github.com/apache/solr-docker](https://github.com/apache/solr-docker), but the image is built and maintained in the official Solr repo [github.com/apache/solr](https://github.com/apache/solr).

Please direct any usage questions to the [Solr users mailing list](https://solr.apache.org/community.html#mailing-lists-chat).

# History

This project was started in 2015 by [Martijn Koster](https://github.com/makuk66) in the [github.com/docker-solr/docker-solr](https://github.com/docker-solr/docker-solr) repository. In 2019, the maintainership and copyright was transferred to the Apache Solr project. Many thanks to Martijn for all your contributions over the years!

# Image Variants

The `solr` images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific use case.

## `solr:<version>`

This is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both as a throw away container (mount your source code and start the container to start your app), as well as the base to build other images off of.

## `solr:<version>-slim`

This image does not contain the common packages contained in the default tag and only contains the minimal packages needed to run `solr`. Unless you are working in an environment where *only* the `solr` image will be deployed and you have space constraints, we highly recommend using the default image of this repository.
