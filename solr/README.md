# What is Solr?

Solr is highly reliable, scalable and fault tolerant, providing distributed indexing, replication and load-balanced querying, automated failover and recovery, centralized configuration and more. Solr powers the search and navigation features of many of the world's largest internet sites.

Learn more on [Apache Solr homepage](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) and in the [Apache Solr Reference Guide](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/solr/ref-guide/).

# How to use this Docker image

To run a single Solr server:

```console
$ docker run --name my_solr -d -p 8983:8983 -t solr
```

Then with a web browser go to `http://localhost:8983/` to see the Admin Console (adjust the hostname for your docker host).

To use Solr, you need to create a "core", an index for your data. For example:

```console
$ docker exec -it --user=solr my_solr bin/solr create_core -c gettingstarted
```

In the web UI if you click on "Core Admin" you should now see the "gettingstarted" core.

If you want to load some example data:

```console
$ docker exec -it --user=solr my_solr bin/post -c gettingstarted example/exampledocs/manufacturers.xml
```

In the UI, find the "Core selector" popup menu and select the "gettingstarted" core, then select the "Query" menu item. This gives you a default search for "*:*" which returns all docs. Hit the "Execute Query" button, and you should see a few docs with data. Congratulations!

To learn more about Solr, see the [Apache Solr Reference Guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Apache+Solr+Reference+Guide).

## Distributed Solr

You can also run a distributed Solr configuration, with Solr nodes in separate containers, sharing a single ZooKeeper server:

Run ZooKeeper, and define a name so we can link to it:

```console
$ docker run --name zookeeper -d -p 2181:2181 -p 2888:2888 -p 3888:3888 jplock/zookeeper
```

Run two Solr nodes, linked to the zookeeper container:

```console
$ docker run --name solr1 --link zookeeper:ZK -d -p 8983:8983 \
      solr \
      bash -c '/opt/solr/bin/solr start -f -z $ZK_PORT_2181_TCP_ADDR:$ZK_PORT_2181_TCP_PORT'

$ docker run --name solr2 --link zookeeper:ZK -d -p 8984:8983 \
      solr \
      bash -c '/opt/solr/bin/solr start -f -z $ZK_PORT_2181_TCP_ADDR:$ZK_PORT_2181_TCP_PORT'
```

Create a collection:

```console
$ docker exec -i -t solr1 /opt/solr/bin/solr create_collection \
        -c collection1 -shards 2 -p 8983
```

Then go to `http://localhost:8983/solr/#/~cloud` (adjust the hostname for your docker host) to see the two shards and Solr nodes.
