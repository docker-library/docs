# About this image

NeuroDebian images only add NeuroDebian repository and repository's GPG key. No apt indexes are downloaded, so `apt-get update` needs to be ran before any use of `apt-get`.

`nd` tags are used to reflect suffixes used in versions of packages available from NeuroDebian.

The `arm32v5/neurodebian:latest` tag will always point the Neurodebian-enabled latest stable release of Debian (which is, at the time of this writing, `debian:wheezy`).

## sources.list

NeuroDebian APT file is installed under `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/neurodebian.sources.list` and currently enables only `main` (DFSG-compliant) area of the archive:

```console
$ docker run arm32v5/neurodebian cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/neurodebian.sources.list
deb http://neuro.debian.net/debian wheezy main
deb http://neuro.debian.net/debian data main
#deb-src http://neuro.debian.net/debian-devel wheezy main
```
