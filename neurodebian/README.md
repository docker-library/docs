# What is NeuroDebian?

NeuroDebian provides a large collection of popular neuroscience research
software for the [Debian](http://www.debian.org) operating system as well as
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) and other derivatives. Popular packages include
*AFNI*, *FSL*, *PyMVPA*, and many others. While we do strive to maintain a high
level of quality, we make no guarantee that a given package works as expected,
so use them at your own risk.

# About this image

NeuroDebian images only add NeuroDebian repository and repository's GPG key. No
apt indexes are downloaded, so `apt-get update` needs to be ran before any use
of `apt-get`.

`nd` tags are used to reflect suffixes used in versions of packages available
from NeuroDebian.

The `neurodebian:latest` tag will always point the Neurodebian-enabled latest
stable release of Debian (which is, at the time of this writing,
`debian:wheezy`).

## sources.list

`/etc/apt/sources.list.d/neurodebian.sources.list` and currently enables only
