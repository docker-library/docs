## What is Amazon Linux?

Amazon Linux is provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is designed to provide a stable, secure, and high-performance execution environment for applications running on Amazon EC2. The full distribution includes packages that enable easy integration with AWS, including launch configuration tools and many popular AWS libraries and tools. AWS provides ongoing security and maintenance updates to all instances running Amazon Linux.

The Amazon Linux container image contains a minimal set of packages. To install additional packages, [use `yum`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/managing-software.html).

AWS provides three versions of Amazon Linux:

-	[Amazon Linux 2023](https://aws.amazon.com/linux/amazon-linux-2023/) (recommended, latest)
-	[Amazon Linux 2](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/)
-	[Amazon Linux AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/)

For information on security updates for Amazon Linux, please refer to:

-	[Amazon Linux 2023 Security Advisories](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/alas2023.html)
-	[Amazon Linux 2 Security Advisories](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/alas2.html)
-	[Amazon Linux AMI Security Advisories](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/)

Note that Docker Hub's vulnerability scanning for Amazon Linux is currently based on RPM versions, which does not reflect the state of backported patches for vulnerabilities.
