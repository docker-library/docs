# What Is Thrift

> The Apache Thrift software framework, for scalable cross-language services development, combines a software stack with a code generation engine to build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between C++, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Perl, Haskell, C#, Cocoa, JavaScript, Node.js, Smalltalk, OCaml and Delphi and other languages.

Read more about [Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org).

# How To Use This Image

This is image is intended to run as an executable. Files are provided by mounting a directory. Here's an example of compiling `service.thrift` to ruby to the current directory.

```console
$ docker run -v "$PWD:/data" thrift thrift -o /data --gen rb /data/service.thrift
```

Note, that you may want to include `-u $(id -u)` to set the UID on generated files. The thrift process runs as root by default which will generate root owned files depending on your docker setup.
