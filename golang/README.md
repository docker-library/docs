# What is Go?

Go (a.k.a., Golang) is a programming language first developed at Google. It is a
statically-typed language with syntax loosely derived from C, but with
additional features such as garbage collection, type safety, some dynamic-typing
capabilities, additional built-in types (e.g., variable-length arrays and
key-value maps), and a large standard library.

# How to use this image

## Start a Go instance in your app

The most straightforward way to use this image is to use a Go container as both
the build and runtime environment. In your `Dockerfile`, writing something along
the lines of the following will compile and run your project:

    FROM golang:1.3-onbuild

This image includes multiple `ONBUILD` triggers which should cover most
applications. The build will `COPY . /usr/src/app`, `RUN go get -d -v`, and `RUN
go install -v`.

This image also includes the `CMD ["app"]` instruction which is the default command
when running the image without arguments.

You can then build and run the Docker image:

    docker build -t my-golang-app .
    docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-golang-app

## Compile your app inside the Docker container

There may be occasions where it is not appropriate to run your app inside a
container. To compile, but not run your app inside the Docker instance, you can
write something like:

    docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp golang:1.3 go build -v

This will add your current directory as a volume to the container, set the
working directory to the volume, and run the command `go build` which will tell
go to compile the project in the working directory and output the executable to
`myapp`. Alternatively, if you have a `Makefile`, you can run the `make` command
inside your container.

    docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp golang:1.3 make

## Cross-compile your app inside the Docker container

If you need to compile your application for a platform other than `linux/amd64`
(such as `windows/386`), this can be easily accomplished with the provided
`cross` tags:

    docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp -e GOOS=windows -e GOARCH=386 golang:1.3-cross go build -v

Alternatively, you can build for multiple platforms at once:

    docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp golang:1.3-cross bash
    $ for GOOS in darwin linux; do
    >   for GOARCH in 386 amd64; do
    >     go build -v -o myapp-$GOOS-$GOARCH
    >   done
    > done
