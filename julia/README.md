# What is Julia?

Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical computing environments. It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function library.

# Support Tiers

Platforms supported by Julia are divided into a tier system that ranks them based on level of support. For more dedicated information about support tiers, please see ["Currently supported platforms" on the Julia download page](https://julialang.org/downloads/#currently_supported_platforms).

It's especially relevant to note that Alpine / musl is "Tier 3" due to several known issues (see [docker-library/julia#47 (comment)](https://github.com/docker-library/julia/pull/47#issuecomment-652661869), [JuliaLang/julia#28805](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/28805), [JuliaLang/julia#36458](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/36458)).
