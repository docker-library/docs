# What is Ubuntu?

Ubuntu is a Debian-based Linux operating system, with Unity as its default desktop environment. It is based on free software and named after the Southern African philosophy of ubuntu (literally, "human-ness"), which often is translated as "humanity towards others" or "the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity".

Development of Ubuntu is led by UK-based Canonical Ltd., a company owned by South African entrepreneur Mark Shuttleworth. Canonical generates revenue through the sale of technical support and other services related to Ubuntu. The Ubuntu project is publicly committed to the principles of open-source software development; people are encouraged to use free software, study how it works, improve upon it, and distribute it.

# What's in this image?

This image is built from official rootfs tarballs provided by Canonical (specifically, https://partner-images.canonical.com/core/).

The `ubuntu:latest` tag points to the "latest LTS", since that's the version recommended for general use.

Along a similar vein, the `ubuntu:devel` tag is an alias for whichever release the "devel" suite on the mirrors currently points to, as determined by the following one-liner: `wget -qO- http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/devel/Release | awk -F ': ' '$1 == "Codename" { print $2; exit }'`
